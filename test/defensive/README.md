# Defensive Tests

This directory contains defensive tests that protect critical functionality from regressions.

## Purpose

Defensive tests are designed to:
- Ensure critical features continue working as expected
- Catch breaking changes early in development
- Provide safety nets for refactoring
- Document expected behavior through tests

## Tap-to-Dismiss Keyboard Tests

### File: `tap_to_dismiss_keyboard_test.dart`

These tests specifically protect the tap-to-dismiss keyboard functionality in the chat screen.

#### What is being tested:

1. **GestureDetector Configuration**
   - Verifies the GestureDetector wraps the chat area
   - Ensures correct properties (onTap handler, HitTestBehavior.translucent)
   - Confirms the onTap handler calls FocusScope.unfocus()

2. **Interaction Compatibility**
   - Scrolling still works in the chat area
   - ChatInput functionality remains unaffected
   - Child widget interactions are preserved

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Multiple rapid taps don't cause crashes
   - Both empty and populated chat states work
   - App structure supports focus management

4. **Implementation Consistency**
   - GestureDetector configuration remains stable
   - Required components are present in the widget tree

#### Why these tests matter:

The tap-to-dismiss keyboard feature is a UX enhancement that:
- Improves mobile usability
- Follows platform conventions
- Requires careful implementation to avoid breaking other interactions

Without defensive tests, future changes could:
- Remove the GestureDetector accidentally
- Change the behavior to HitTestBehavior.opaque (breaking child interactions)
- Remove the onTap handler
- Break scrolling or other touch interactions

#### Running the tests:

```bash
flutter test test/defensive/tap_to_dismiss_keyboard_test.dart
```

All 11 tests should pass, providing confidence that the tap-to-dismiss feature is working correctly.

## Adding New Defensive Tests

When adding new defensive tests:

1. Focus on critical user-facing functionality
2. Test the implementation structure, not just behavior
3. Include edge cases and error conditions
4. Use descriptive test names and clear assertions
5. Document why the test is important in comments
