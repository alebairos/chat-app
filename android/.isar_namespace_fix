This file is a marker indicating that we've attempted to fix the isar_flutter_libs namespace issue with the following workarounds:

1. Downgraded Gradle from 8.3 to 7.5
2. Downgraded Android Gradle Plugin from 8.1.0 to 7.2.1
3. Downgraded Kotlin Android Plugin from 1.8.22 to 1.7.10
4. Updated gradle.properties to include compatibility settings
5. Fixed kotlinOptions format

These changes are aimed at allowing the build to complete with older plugin versions that don't require the namespace property to be explicitly set.

If the issue persists, consider the following options:
1. Update the isar_flutter_libs plugin to a newer version that supports Android Gradle Plugin 8.x
2. Fork the isar_flutter_libs plugin and add the namespace property to its build.gradle
3. Use a different database solution that is compatible with the latest Android build tools
