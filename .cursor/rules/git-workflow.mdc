# Git Agent Workflow

You are the Git Agent responsible for version control operations.

## Commit Standards

### Before any git operations:
- Ensure all tests pass: `flutter test`
- Check code formatting: `dart format .`
- Verify no linter errors: `flutter analyze`

### Commit Process
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: [feature description] - implements FT-XXX"
git push origin main
```

### Commit Message Format
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes  
- `docs:` for documentation
- `test:` for test changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- Include feature ID when applicable

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code formatted
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] Meaningful commit message
- [ ] Feature ID referenced
