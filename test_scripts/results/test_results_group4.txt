🧪 Testing comparison between MCP service and direct CSV loading...
📝 Claude prompt:       I need to see all the goals related to physical health. 
      Please use the get_goals_by_dimension command with dimension SF to retrieve them.
      
🔍 This prompt would trigger the MCP service to fetch goals with dimension "SF"
📊 Retrieved 6 goals via MCP service
📊 Retrieved 6 goals directly from CSV
✓ MCP service and direct CSV loading return identical goals
✓ All expected goals from Objetivos.csv are present in the results
