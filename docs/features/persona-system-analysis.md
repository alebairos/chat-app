### System Architecture

The persona system is built on several key architectural principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Character configuration, voice settings, and UI components are separated into distinct modules
2. **Configuration-Driven**: Each persona is defined through JSON configuration files containing prompts and personality traits
3. **Pluggable Voice System**: Voice characteristics are configurable per character and integrated with TTS services
4. **Singleton Management**: A centralized character manager ensures consistent state across the application

## Technical Implementation

### Character Configuration Manager

The `CharacterConfigManager` serves as the central hub for persona management:

```dart
class CharacterConfigManager {
  static final CharacterConfigManager _instance = CharacterConfigManager._internal();
  
  CharacterPersona _activePersona = CharacterPersona.personalDevelopmentAssistant;
  
  String get configFilePath {
    switch (_activePersona) {
      case CharacterPersona.personalDevelopmentAssistant:
        return 'lib/config/claude_config.json';
      case CharacterPersona.sergeantOracle:
        return 'lib/config/sergeant_oracle_config.json';
      case CharacterPersona.zenGuide:
        return 'lib/config/zen_guide_config.json';
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Files Structure

Each persona has a dedicated JSON configuration file:

```json
{
  "system_prompt": {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "Character-specific system prompt..."
  },
  "exploration_prompts": {
    "physical": "Domain-specific guidance prompt...",
    "mental": "Mental wellbeing guidance prompt...",
    "relationships": "Relationship guidance prompt...",
    "spirituality": "Spiritual growth guidance prompt...",
    "work": "Career/work guidance prompt..."
  }
}
```

### Voice Integration System

The system integrates character personalities with voice characteristics:

```dart
class AudioAssistantTTSService {
  Future<bool> applyCharacterVoice() async {
    try {
      final characterName = _configLoader.activePersonaDisplayName;
      final characterConfig = CharacterVoiceConfig.getVoiceConfig(characterName);
      
      // Apply character-specific configuration to TTS provider
      final success = await updateProviderConfig(characterConfig);
      return success;
    } catch (e) {
      _logger.error('Error applying character voice configuration: $e');
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

### Character Selection Interface

The `CharacterSelectionScreen` provides an intuitive interface for persona switching:

```dart
class CharacterSelectionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final availablePersonas = _configLoader.availablePersonas;
    
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: availablePersonas.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        final persona = availablePersonas[index];
        // Display persona with description and selection capability
      },
    );
  }
}
```
