# Feature ft_012: Ari Life Coach Persona Integration

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the integration of "Ari," a sophisticated Life Management Coach persona, into the chat app. Ari combines evidence-based behavioral science with practical coaching methodologies, integrating insights from 9 leading experts in neuroplasticity, habit formation, and human potential development.

### Background & Context

Based on the comprehensive Life Management Coach system from the Oracle project, Ari represents a quantum leap in coaching sophistication. The original system utilizes:
- **1000+ scientifically-catalogued habits** across 5 human potential dimensions
- **999 progressive challenge tracks** with structured difficulty levels
- **21 specific objectives** mapped to targeted interventions
- **OKR framework** for personal development goal setting

### Problem Statement

Current chat app personas (Sergeant Oracle, Zen Master) provide general guidance but lack:
1. **Structured behavioral interventions** based on scientific evidence
2. **Progressive coaching methodologies** with measurable outcomes
3. **Comprehensive habit catalogues** for personalized recommendations
4. **Integrated goal-setting frameworks** (OKRs) for sustained development

### Product Vision

**"Enable users to access world-class life coaching through Ari - an AI persona that combines the wisdom of 9 behavioral science experts with a comprehensive intervention catalogue for measurable personal transformation."**

### Target Users
