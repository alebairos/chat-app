## Debugging Tips

### If You See Repeated Responses

1. **Check the exact text:**
   - Is it word-for-word identical?
   - Or just similar in meaning?

2. **Note when it happens:**
   - After which message number?
   - With which persona?
   - What type of message triggered it?

3. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   # In terminal where app is running
   # Look for: "FT-210" in logs
   # Check _conversationHistory length
   ```

4. **Export conversation:**
   - Use chat export feature
   - Share with developer for analysis

### If Persona Seems Confused

1. **Check if it's the duplicate bug:**
   - Does persona ignore your last message?
   - Does persona ask the same question twice?

2. **Or is it a different issue:**
   - Persona gives wrong information?
   - Persona doesn't understand command?
   - Persona loses context after many turns?
