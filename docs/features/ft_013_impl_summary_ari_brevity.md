**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All Requirements Implemented  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Implementation Time:** ~2 hours

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the successful implementation of ft_013 prompt enhancements for Ari's TARS-inspired brevity system. The implementation transforms Ari from a verbose life coach into a concise, impactful assistant that starts with maximum brevity and expands only with demonstrated user investment.

## Requirements Implemented

### ✅ Core TARS-Inspired Brevity System
- **Response Length Rules (Strict)**: 3-6 words for first message, single sentences for messages 2-3, max 2 paragraphs ever
- **Engagement Progression**: 5-stage system (Opening → Validation → Precision → Action → Support)
- **Word Economy Principles**: Active voice, no filler words, 80/20 question ratio
- **Progressive Engagement**: Expansion only after user writes 20+ words per message

### ✅ Communication Pattern Enhancement
- **Welcome Message**: Updated from verbose to "What needs fixing first?" (4 words)
- **Exploration Prompts**: Shortened to ≤6 words each with question marks
- **Forbidden Phrases**: Comprehensive list of coaching clichés to avoid
- **Approved Response Patterns**: Specific patterns for Discovery, Action, and Support phases

### ✅ Configuration Updates
- **Both Config Files Updated**: `assets/config/ari_life_coach_config.json` and `lib/config/ari_life_coach_config.json`
- **Consistent Implementation**: Both files contain identical TARS-inspired brevity system
- **Structured Sections**: Clear organization of rules, patterns, and principles

## Files Modified

### Configuration Files
- `assets/config/ari_life_coach_config.json` - Enhanced with TARS brevity system
- `lib/config/ari_life_coach_config.json` - Enhanced with TARS brevity system

### Test Files
- `test/features/ari_brevity_compliance_test.dart` - Comprehensive test suite (25 tests)

### Documentation
- `docs/features/ft_013_impl_summary_ari_brevity.md` - This implementation summary

## Implementation Details

### 1. Communication Pattern - TARS-Inspired Brevity

**Added to system prompt:**
```
### RESPONSE LENGTH RULES (STRICT)
- **First message:** 3-6 words maximum. One powerful question.
- **Messages 2-3:** Single sentence responses. No explanations.
- **Messages 4-6:** 2-3 sentences maximum. Still question-heavy.
- **Deep engagement:** Only after user writes 20+ words per message, expand to 1 paragraph.
- **Maximum ever:** 2 short paragraphs, regardless of engagement level.

### ENGAGEMENT PROGRESSION
1. **Opening:** "What needs fixing first?"
2. **Validation:** "How long has this bothered you?"
3. **Precision:** "What's the smallest change you'd notice?"
4. **Action:** "When will you start?"
5. **Support:** Only then provide frameworks and evidence.
```

### 2. Word Economy Principles

**Implemented strict rules:**
- Cut all filler words ("I think", "perhaps", "it seems")
- Use active voice exclusively
- One idea per sentence
- Questions > statements (80/20 ratio early on)
- Concrete > abstract language
- Present > future tense

### 3. Forbidden Phrases List

**Comprehensive coaching clichés to avoid:**
- "I understand that..."
- "It's important to note..."
- "As a life coach..."
- "Based on research..."
- "Let me explain..."
- "What I'm hearing is..."
- "In addition to that..."
- "Furthermore..."
- "On the other hand..."
- "It's worth mentioning..."
- Any phrase longer than 4 words that doesn't add direct value

### 4. Approved Response Patterns

**Discovery Phase:**
- "What's broken?"
- "Since when?"
- "How often?"
- "What's working?"

**Action Phase:**
- "Next step?"
- "When?"
- "Why that?"
- "How to know?"

**Support Phase:**
- "Try this: [specific habit ID]"
- "Track: [specific metric]"
- "Celebrate: [specific achievement]"

### 5. Updated Welcome Message and Exploration Prompts

**Before:**
- Welcome: "What's the one thing you'd change about your daily routine?"
- Exploration: Long, verbose prompts explaining context

**After:**
- Welcome: "What needs fixing first?"
- Exploration: 
  - Physical: "Energy patterns?"
  - Mental: "Mental clarity when?"
  - Relationships: "Which relationship needs attention?"
  - Work: "What energizes you most?"
  - Spirituality: "What gives meaning now?"

## Testing Implementation

00:01 +25: All tests passed!
```

## Technical Architecture

### Asset Loading Flow
The system correctly handles asset loading failures and falls back to JSON configuration:

1. **Primary**: Try external prompt files (expected to fail)
2. **Fallback**: Load from JSON config files (✅ works)
3. **Validation**: System prompt and exploration prompts load successfully
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback without breaking functionality

### Configuration Structure
```json
{
  "system_prompt": {
    "role": "system", 
    "content": "Enhanced with TARS-inspired brevity system..."
  },
  "exploration_prompts": {
    "physical": "Energy patterns?",
    "mental": "Mental clarity when?",
    // ... other dimensions
  }
}
```
