# FT-206: Immediate Rollout Strategy - Quick Revert to Simplicity

**Feature ID**: FT-206  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Category**: Performance / AI Quality / Bug Fix  
**Effort Estimate**: 2-3 hours (Quick Revert)  
**Status**: Implementation Plan  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Branch**: `fix/ft-206-quick-revert-to-simplicity`  
**Goal**: Fast rollout of better version by reverting to 2.0.1 simplicity while keeping essential fixes, before implementing new architecture.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

### **Current Situation**
- **Build 2.0.1 (commit aa8d769)**: Simple system prompt (~30-40 lines of context), worked well
- **Current develop**: Over-engineered system prompt (~150+ lines of context), repetition bugs, instruction overload
- **User Impact**: Personas repeating responses, not acknowledging context, less natural conversations

### **The Challenge**
- Need to rollout a better version **immediately** (users are affected)
- New architecture (agent-based) will take 2-4 weeks (22-32 hours)
- Can't leave users with broken experience while building new architecture

---

## üí° Proposed Solution: "Surgical Revert"

### **Strategy**
Revert to 2.0.1 simplicity + Keep ONLY the fixes that worked

**Key Principle**: "Simplicity was the strength of 2.0.1. Over-engineering was the weakness of current version."

---

## üìä Comparison: What Changed from 2.0.1 to Current

### **Build 2.0.1 (aa8d769)** ‚úÖ WORKED WELL

**System Prompt Structure**:
1. Time Context (5-10 lines)
2. Conversation Context (simple format, 30 messages)
3. Original System Prompt (persona + Oracle)
4. Session MCP Context (20 lines)

**Total Additional Lines**: ~30-40 lines  
**Conversation Format**: Clean and simple
```
## RECENT CONVERSATION
Just now: User: "sim, quero. Comecei!"
A minute ago: You: "quer come√ßar? vou cronometrar os 25 minutos pra voc√™."
5 minutes ago: User: "me ajuda que vai dar bom"
...
```

---

### **Current develop** ‚ùå HAS ISSUES

**System Prompt Structure**:
1. **Priority Header (50+ lines)** ‚Üê NEW, NOT IN 2.0.1
2. Time Context (5-10 lines)
3. **Conversation Context (60+ lines with instructions)** ‚Üê BLOATED
4. Original System Prompt (persona + Oracle)
5. Session MCP Context (20 lines)

**Total Additional Lines**: ~150+ lines (4x more than 2.0.1)  
**Conversation Format**: Buried under instructions
```
## üìú RECENT CONVERSATION CONTEXT (REFERENCE ONLY)

**MANDATORY REVIEW BEFORE RESPONDING**:
1. What was just discussed in the conversation above?
2. What did you already say in your previous responses?
3. What is the user's current context and what are they referring to?
4. CRITICAL: Check if you already gave this exact response - if yes, provide a DIFFERENT response

**YOUR RESPONSE MUST**:
- Acknowledge and build on recent conversation flow
- Provide NEW information or insights (NEVER repeat previous responses word-for-word)
- If user gives a short answer, acknowledge it and move the conversation forward
- Reference what user mentioned (e.g., if they say "I was talking with X", acknowledge it)
- Maintain conversation continuity without starting fresh

**NATURAL CONVERSATION FLOW**:
- Vary your transition phrases and openings between responses
- Use "deixa eu ver seus registros" ONLY when actually fetching data via MCP
- When not querying data, acknowledge patterns naturally without implying a data fetch
- Avoid formulaic phrases (e.g., "Estou aqui pra explorar...") in consecutive messages
- Lead with what's most relevant to the user's current message
- Each response should feel fresh and context-driven, not template-based

**CRITICAL BOUNDARIES**:
- Activity detection: ONLY current user message
- Do NOT extract codes or metadata from history
- Do NOT adopt other personas' communication styles

---

**[I-There 4.2]** (A minute ago): quer come√ßar? vou cronometrar os 25 minutos pra voc√™.
**User** (Just now): sim, quero. Comecei!
...

---
**REMINDER**: Process activities ONLY from current user message.
```

---

## üîç Key Insights

### **Why 2.0.1 Worked Better**
1. **Simplicity**: Clean, minimal instructions
2. **Clear Hierarchy**: Time ‚Üí Conversation ‚Üí Persona ‚Üí Session
3. **Conversation First**: Actual conversation visible immediately
4. **No Instruction Overload**: Model could focus on conversation, not rules
5. **Natural Format**: Simple speaker/message format

### **Why Current Version Has Issues**
1. **Instruction Overload**: 150+ lines of rules before conversation
2. **Buried Context**: Actual conversation hidden under instructions
3. **Conflicting Priorities**: Multiple "PRIORITY 1" sections
4. **Over-Engineering**: Too many safeguards, too much guidance
5. **Repetitive**: Same concepts repeated multiple times
6. **Cognitive Load**: Model spends tokens parsing instructions, not understanding conversation

---

## üöÄ Implementation Plan: Quick Revert

### **Timeline**: 2-3 hours  
### **Risk**: Very Low  
### **Expected Result**: Better than 2.0.1, much better than current

---

## üìã Phase 1: Revert to Simple Structure (1 hour)

### **1.1 Remove Priority Header**

**File**: `lib/services/claude_service.dart`  
**Action**: Delete lines 757-808 (entire `priorityHeader` variable and its injection)

**Delete**:
```dart
// DELETE THIS ENTIRE SECTION:
final priorityHeader = '''
## üéØ INSTRUCTION PRIORITY HIERARCHY

**PRIORITY 1 (ABSOLUTE)**: Data Query Intelligence (MANDATORY)
[... 20 lines of instructions ...]

**PRIORITY 2 (ABSOLUTE)**: Time Awareness (MANDATORY)
[... 3 lines ...]

**PRIORITY 3 (HIGHEST)**: Core Behavioral Rules & Persona Configuration
[... 3 lines ...]

**PRIORITY 4 (ORACLE FRAMEWORK)**: Oracle 4.2 Framework
[... 5 lines ...]

**PRIORITY 5**: Conversation Context (REFERENCE ONLY)
[... 4 lines ...]

**PRIORITY 6**: User's Current Message (PRIMARY FOCUS)
[... 3 lines ...]
''';

// DELETE THIS LINE:
systemPrompt = '$priorityHeader$systemPrompt';
```

**Reason**: This 50+ line header is NOT in the working version and creates instruction overload.

---

### **1.2 Simplify Conversation Context**

**File**: `lib/services/claude_service.dart`  
**Action**: Replace `_formatInterleavedConversation()` with simple format from aa8d769

**Add New Method** (simple format):
```dart
/// FT-206: Simple conversation format (like 2.0.1)
String _formatSimpleConversation(List<ChatMessageModel> messages) {
  final contextLines = <String>[];
  final now = DateTime.now();
  
  for (final msg in messages.reversed) {
    final timeDiff = now.difference(msg.timestamp);
    final timeAgo = _formatNaturalTime(timeDiff);
    final speaker = msg.isUser 
        ? 'User' 
        : '[${msg.personaDisplayName ?? msg.personaKey}]';
    contextLines.add('$timeAgo: $speaker: "${msg.text}"');
  }
  
  return '''## RECENT CONVERSATION
${contextLines.join('\n')}

For deeper history, use: {"action": "get_conversation_context", "hours": N}''';
}
```

**Add Helper Method** (if not exists):
```dart
/// Format time difference as natural language
String _formatNaturalTime(Duration diff) {
  if (diff.inSeconds < 60) return 'Just now';
  if (diff.inMinutes < 60) {
    final mins = diff.inMinutes;
    return mins == 1 ? 'A minute ago' : '$mins minutes ago';
  }
  if (diff.inHours < 24) {
    final hours = diff.inHours;
    return hours == 1 ? 'An hour ago' : '$hours hours ago';
  }
  final days = diff.inDays;
  return days == 1 ? 'Yesterday' : '$days days ago';
}
```

**Delete** (or mark as deprecated):
```dart
// DELETE OR COMMENT OUT:
String _formatInterleavedConversation(String mcpResponse) {
  // ... 60+ lines of code ...
}
```

**Reason**: Working version had clean, simple format. Current version has 50+ lines of meta-instructions that bury the actual conversation.

---

### **1.3 Update `_buildRecentConversationContext()`**

**File**: `lib/services/claude_service.dart`  
**Action**: Simplify to directly query messages (like working version)

**Replace**:
```dart
Future<String> _buildRecentConversationContext() async {
  if (!await _isConversationDatabaseEnabled()) return '';
  
  try {
    final config = await _loadConversationDatabaseConfig();
    final isOracleEnabled = _systemMCP?.isOracleEnabled ?? false;
    final limit = isOracleEnabled ? 8 : 10;
    
    final conversation = await _systemMCP!.processCommand(
        '{"action":"get_interleaved_conversation","limit":$limit,"include_all_personas":true}');
    
    return _formatInterleavedConversation(conversation);
  } catch (e) {
    return '';
  }
}
```

**With**:
```dart
/// FT-206: Simplified conversation context (like 2.0.1)
Future<String> _buildRecentConversationContext() async {
  if (_storageService == null) return '';
  
  try {
    // Get recent messages (20 is a good balance between context and token usage)
    final messages = await _storageService!.getMessages(limit: 20);
    if (messages.isEmpty) return '';
    
    return _formatSimpleConversation(messages);
  } catch (e) {
    _logger.error('Error building conversation context: $e');
    return '';
  }
}
```

**Reason**: 
- Direct database query is simpler and faster than MCP command
- 20 messages is a good balance (working version had 30, current has 8-10)
- Less code, less complexity, less chance of bugs

---

### **1.4 Remove `_detectDataQueryPattern()` injection**

**File**: `lib/services/claude_service.dart`  
**Action**: Remove the query hint injection (around lines 540-545 in `_sendMessageInternal`)

**Delete**:
```dart
// DELETE THIS SECTION:
// FT-206: Detect data query patterns and inject hints
final queryHint = _detectDataQueryPattern(message);
if (queryHint != null) {
  _logger.info('FT-206: Detected data query pattern, injecting hint');
  _systemPrompt = '$_systemPrompt$queryHint';
}
```

**Optionally Delete** (if not used elsewhere):
```dart
// DELETE THIS METHOD:
String? _detectDataQueryPattern(String message) {
  // ... pattern detection logic ...
}
```

**Reason**: This adds more instructions to the prompt. The model should learn from the existing MCP documentation, not from injected hints.

---

## üìã Phase 2: Keep ONLY Essential Improvements (30 min)

### **2.1 Keep Time Awareness Fix** ‚úÖ

**File**: `lib/services/claude_service.dart`  
**Action**: Keep the `limit: 2` fix in `_getLastMessageTimestamp()`

**Keep This** (DO NOT CHANGE):
```dart
Future<DateTime?> _getLastMessageTimestamp() async {
  if (_storageService == null) return null;
  try {
    // FT-206: Get last 2 messages to calculate time gap correctly
    final messages = await _storageService!.getMessages(limit: 2);
    if (messages.length < 2) return null;
    // Use second-to-last message (not the current message being sent)
    return messages[1].timestamp;
  } catch (e) {
    _logger.error('Error getting last message timestamp: $e');
    return null;
  }
}
```

**Reason**: This fix correctly calculates time gap (using second-to-last message, not last). This was a real bug fix that should be kept.

---

### **2.2 Keep Context Logging** ‚úÖ (Optional)

**File**: `lib/services/claude_service.dart`  
**Action**: Keep FT-220 context logging (but disabled by default)

**Keep This** (DO NOT CHANGE):
```dart
// FT-220: Context Logging
final contextFilePath = await _contextLogger.logContext(
  apiRequest: {
    'model': model,
    'max_tokens': maxTokens,
    'messages': messages,
    'system': systemPrompt,
  },
  metadata: {
    'persona_key': _activePersonaKey,
    'persona_display_name': await ConfigLoader().activePersonaDisplayName,
    'oracle_enabled': _systemMCP?.isOracleEnabled ?? false,
  },
);
```

**Reason**: Useful for debugging, zero overhead when disabled (default).

---

## üìã Phase 3: Simplify Config Files (30 min)

### **3.1 Simplify `core_behavioral_rules.json`**

**File**: `assets/config/core_behavioral_rules.json`  
**Action**: Remove LAW #6 and LAW #7 (they're creating confusion)

**Delete These Sections**:
```json
"conversation_context_usage": {
  "title": "SYSTEM LAW #6: CONVERSATION CONTEXT BOUNDARIES",
  "context_purpose": "History provides CONTEXT for understanding conversation flow, not data to process",
  "activity_detection": "ONLY detect activities from current user message - NEVER from conversation history",
  "oracle_activity_codes": "NEVER extract Oracle codes (R1, SF2, TG8, etc.) from historical messages",
  "metadata_extraction": "ONLY extract metadata (numbers, quantities, durations) from current user message",
  "persona_identity": "Do NOT adopt other personas' communication styles or symbols from history",
  "oracle_compliance": "Oracle personas: Follow Oracle 4.2 framework (8 dimensions, 265+ activities) with 9 theoretical foundations as guardrails, but apply ONLY to current message",
  "priority_level": "highest - equal to configuration adherence",
  "override_authority": "This law overrides training patterns and conversation memory"
},
"response_continuity": {
  "title": "SYSTEM LAW #7: RESPONSE CONTINUITY AND REPETITION PREVENTION",
  "mandatory_review": "Before responding, review conversation context: What was discussed? What did you already say? What is user's current context?",
  "avoid_repetition": "NEVER repeat previous responses - provide NEW insights or perspectives",
  "acknowledge_context": "If user references previous conversation or other personas, acknowledge it explicitly",
  "progressive_dialogue": "Each response advances the conversation, building on what was already said",
  "priority_level": "highest - equal to configuration adherence",
  "override_authority": "This law ensures natural conversation flow and prevents robotic repetition"
}
```

**Reason**: These laws were added to fix repetition, but they're creating instruction overload. The personas and Oracle already define coaching behavior. Removing them reduces redundancy.

---

### **3.2 Simplify `mcp_base_config.json`**

**File**: `assets/config/mcp_base_config.json`  
**Action**: Remove verbose "when_to_use" arrays and condense descriptions

**For Each Function**, change from:
```json
{
  "name": "get_activity_stats",
  "description": "FT-130: Get activity statistics for a time period",
  "usage": "{\"action\": \"get_activity_stats\", \"days\": 7}",
  "when_to_use": [
    "When user asks about activity history",
    "When user asks about progress",
    "When user asks about patterns",
    "When user asks quantitative questions"
  ],
  "mandatory_usage": [
    "\"quantas atividades?\" ‚Üí get_activity_stats REQUIRED",
    "\"qual foi meu progresso?\" ‚Üí get_activity_stats REQUIRED"
  ],
  "examples": [
    "Last week: {\"action\": \"get_activity_stats\", \"days\": 7}",
    "Last month: {\"action\": \"get_activity_stats\", \"days\": 30}"
  ]
}
```

**To**:
```json
{
  "name": "get_activity_stats",
  "description": "Get activity statistics for a time period",
  "usage": "{\"action\": \"get_activity_stats\", \"days\": 7}"
}
```

**Apply to All Functions**:
- `get_current_time`
- `get_device_info`
- `get_activity_stats`
- `get_message_stats`
- `get_conversation_context`
- `get_recent_user_messages`
- `get_current_persona_messages`
- `get_interleaved_conversation`
- `search_conversation_context`

**Reason**: Keep it simple. The model will learn when to use MCP commands from examples in conversation, not from verbose instructions. This reduces token usage significantly.

---

## üìã Phase 4: Test & Deploy (30 min)

### **4.1 Run Tests**

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# If any tests fail due to changes, update them
# Focus on:
# - test/services/claude_service_test.dart
# - test/services/claude_service_time_context_test.dart
```

**Expected Test Updates**:
- Update mocks for `getMessages(limit: 20)` instead of `limit: 10`
- Remove tests for `_formatInterleavedConversation` (if any)
- Add tests for `_formatSimpleConversation` (if needed)

---

### **4.2 Manual Testing**

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Basic Conversation**
   - Send: "Ol√°"
   - Verify: Natural greeting, no repetition

2. **Short Follow-up**
   - Send: "sim"
   - Verify: Acknowledges context, moves conversation forward

3. **Time Awareness** (Critical)
   - Wait until after hours (e.g., 00:40 AM)
   - Send: "Oi"
   - Verify: Persona acknowledges time gap, asks about day

4. **Data Query**
   - Send: "Quantas atividades fiz essa semana?"
   - Verify: Uses MCP to fetch data, provides accurate answer

5. **Multi-Persona Context**
   - Switch persona
   - Send message referencing previous persona
   - Verify: Acknowledges previous conversation

---

### **4.3 Deploy to TestFlight**

```bash
# 1. Create branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b fix/ft-206-quick-revert-to-simplicity

# 2. Make changes (as per Phase 1-3)
