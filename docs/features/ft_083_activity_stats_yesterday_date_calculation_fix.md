# FT-083: Activity Stats Yesterday Date Calculation Fix

**Feature ID**: FT-083  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Bug Fix / Data Query  
**Effort Estimate**: 30 minutes  
**Dependencies**: ActivityMemoryService, SystemMCP  
**Status**: Specification  

## Overview

Fix incorrect date calculation in `ActivityMemoryService.getActivityStats()` that prevents users from querying yesterday's activities. When users ask "o que eu fiz ontem?" (what did I do yesterday?), the system incorrectly queries today's data instead of the previous day's activities.

## Problem Description

### Current Behavior
```
User: "o que eu fiz ontem?" (what did I do yesterday?)
AI generates: {"action": "get_activity_stats", "days": 1}
System queries: Sunday's activities (today)
Expected: Saturday's activities (yesterday)
```

### Issue Details
- **Wrong date range**: `days: 1` queries today instead of yesterday
- **User confusion**: System shows "no activities" when yesterday had activities
- **Inconsistent expectations**: Users expect "yesterday" to mean the previous day
- **Date boundary bug**: Occurs especially after midnight transitions

### Root Cause Analysis

**File**: `lib/services/activity_memory_service.dart`  
**Lines**: 413-415

```dart
// CURRENT (INCORRECT) LOGIC
final now = DateTime.now();
final startDate = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day)
    .subtract(Duration(days: days - 1));

// EXAMPLE: When days = 1 (yesterday request)
// startDate = today.subtract(Duration(days: 0)) = TODAY
// Result: Queries today instead of yesterday
```

### Date Calculation Logic Error

**Current Logic (Wrong):**
- `days: 1` ‚Üí `subtract(Duration(days: 0))` ‚Üí **Today**
- `days: 2` ‚Üí `subtract(Duration(days: 1))` ‚Üí **Yesterday + Today**

**Expected Logic (Correct):**
- `days: 1` ‚Üí `subtract(Duration(days: 1))` ‚Üí **Yesterday**
- `days: 2` ‚Üí `subtract(Duration(days: 2))` ‚Üí **Yesterday + Day Before**

## User Story

As a user asking about yesterday's activities, I want the system to correctly query the previous day's data so that I can review what I accomplished yesterday, especially when asking late at night or after midnight.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-083-01: Correct Yesterday Date Calculation
- **Fix date range logic** to properly calculate "yesterday" when `days: 1`
- **Maintain backward compatibility** for existing multi-day queries
- **Handle midnight transitions** correctly across day boundaries
- **Preserve timezone handling** for accurate local date calculations

### FR-083-02: Intuitive Date Range Behavior
- **`days: 1`** should query **yesterday's activities** (previous day)
- **`days: 2`** should query **last 2 days** (yesterday + day before)
- **`days: 7`** should query **last 7 days** (previous week)
- **Consistent with user expectations** of "yesterday" meaning "previous day"

### FR-083-03: Robust Date Boundary Handling
- **Midnight transitions**: Correctly handle queries after 00:00
- **Weekend boundaries**: Properly calculate Friday when asked on Monday
- **Month boundaries**: Handle cross-month date calculations
- **Year boundaries**: Handle cross-year date calculations (December ‚Üí January)

## Technical Implementation

### Core Fix: Date Calculation Logic

**File**: `lib/services/activity_memory_service.dart`  
**Method**: `getActivityStats()`  
**Lines**: 413-415

#### Before (Incorrect)
```dart
// Calculate date range
final now = DateTime.now();
final startDate = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day)
    .subtract(Duration(days: days - 1)); // ‚ùå WRONG: days - 1
```

#### After (Correct)
```dart
// Calculate date range for previous days
final now = DateTime.now();
final today = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day);
final startDate = today.subtract(Duration(days: days)); // ‚úÖ CORRECT: days

// Query from start of target day to end of last day in range
final endDate = today.subtract(Duration(days: 1)); // End of yesterday
final queryEndDate = DateTime(endDate.year, endDate.month, endDate.day, 23, 59, 59);
```

### Enhanced Implementation with Proper Range

```dart
static Future<Map<String, dynamic>> getActivityStats({int days = 1}) async {
  try {
    print('üîç ActivityMemoryService: getActivityStats called for $days days');

    // Check if database is available before proceeding
    final dbAvailable = await isDatabaseAvailable();
    if (!dbAvailable) {
      // ... existing error handling
    }

    print('‚úÖ ActivityMemoryService: Database available, proceeding with query');

    // FIXED: Calculate correct date range for previous days
    final now = DateTime.now();
    final today = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day);
    
    // For "yesterday" queries (days: 1), we want the previous day
    final startDate = today.subtract(Duration(days: days));
    final endDate = today.subtract(Duration(days: 1));
    final queryEndDate = DateTime(endDate.year, endDate.month, endDate.day, 23, 59, 59);

    print(
        'üîç ActivityMemoryService: Querying activities from ${startDate.toIso8601String()} to ${queryEndDate.toIso8601String()}');

    // Get activities in corrected timeframe
    final activities = await _database.activityModels
        .filter()
        .completedAtBetween(startDate, queryEndDate)
        .sortByCompletedAtDesc()
        .findAll();

    print('‚úÖ ActivityMemoryService: Found ${activities.length} activities');

    // ... rest of method unchanged
  } catch (e) {
    // ... existing error handling
  }
}
```

### Alternative Simpler Fix

If we want to maintain the existing query pattern but fix the logic:

```dart
// Simple fix: Just change the subtraction logic
final startDate = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day)
    .subtract(Duration(days: days)); // Remove the "- 1"

// This makes:
// days: 1 ‚Üí subtract 1 day ‚Üí yesterday ‚úÖ
// days: 2 ‚Üí subtract 2 days ‚Üí day before yesterday + yesterday ‚úÖ
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix (Current Bug)
```
User: "o que eu fiz ontem?" (Saturday night, asking about Friday)
System: Queries Saturday's activities
Result: Shows Saturday's activities instead of Friday's
User sees: Wrong day's data
```

### After Fix (Correct Behavior)
```
User: "o que eu fiz ontem?" (Saturday night, asking about Friday)  
System: Queries Friday's activities
Result: Shows Friday's activities correctly
User sees: Correct previous day's data
```

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Late Night Query
- **Time**: Sunday 00:54 AM
- **User asks**: "o que eu fiz ontem?" (what did I do yesterday?)
- **Expected**: Saturday's activities
- **Current**: Sunday's activities (wrong)
- **After fix**: Saturday's activities (correct)

#### Scenario 2: Multi-Day Query
- **Time**: Wednesday 15:30
- **User asks**: "√∫ltimos 3 dias" (last 3 days)
- **Expected**: Sunday + Monday + Tuesday
- **Current**: Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday (wrong)
- **After fix**: Sunday + Monday + Tuesday (correct)

#### Scenario 3: Weekend Boundary
- **Time**: Monday 09:00
- **User asks**: "o que fiz ontem?" (what did I do yesterday?)
- **Expected**: Sunday's activities
- **Current**: Monday's activities (wrong)
- **After fix**: Sunday's activities (correct)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Modify date calculation logic** in `ActivityMemoryService.getActivityStats()`
2. **Update query range** to use corrected start and end dates
3. **Test with various scenarios** (midnight, weekends, month boundaries)
4. **Verify backward compatibility** for multi-day queries
5. **Update logging** to reflect correct date ranges being queried

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
```dart
testYesterdayQuery() {
  // Given: Current time is Sunday 00:54
  // When: getActivityStats(days: 1) is called
  // Then: Should query Saturday's activities, not Sunday's
}

testMultiDayQuery() {
  // Given: Current time is Wednesday 15:30
  // When: getActivityStats(days: 3) is called  
  // Then: Should query Sun + Mon + Tue, not Mon + Tue + Wed
}

testMidnightBoundary() {
  // Given: Current time is just after midnight
  // When: Querying yesterday's activities
  // Then: Should correctly identify previous day
}
```

### Integration Tests
- Test with real activity data across day boundaries
- Verify persona responses show correct day's activities
- Test MCP command processing with corrected date ranges
- Validate user experience with "yesterday" queries

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Factors
- **Isolated change**: Only affects date calculation logic
- **Backward compatible**: Multi-day queries still work correctly
- **Clear fix**: Simple mathematical correction
- **Well-tested area**: Activity queries are frequently used

### Validation Strategy
- **Test before deployment**: Verify fix with various time scenarios
- **Monitor after deployment**: Check that "yesterday" queries work correctly
- **User feedback**: Confirm improved experience with historical activity queries

## Success Metrics

// NOT covered - would need additional implementation
"last week" ‚Üí Previous Monday-Sunday calendar week
"last month" ‚Üí Previous calendar month (January, February, etc.)
"this week" ‚Üí Current Monday-Sunday week
"this month" ‚Üí Current calendar month
```

#### **2. Relative Time Expressions**
```dart
// NOT covered - Claude would need to interpret these
"semana passada" ‚Üí Specific calendar week
"m√™s passado" ‚Üí Specific calendar month  
"segunda-feira passada" ‚Üí Last Monday specifically
"fim de semana passado" ‚Üí Last Saturday-Sunday
```

#### **3. Contextual Intelligence**
