# Feature 051: Audio Message UI Enhancement

## Overview
Enhance the audio message UI to provide a better user experience by showing transcription text expanded by default and displaying real-time playback duration with pause/play functionality, while removing unnecessary controls.

## Problem Statement
Currently, audio messages have inconsistent behavior between user and assistant messages:
- **Assistant audio messages**: Transcription is collapsed by default, requiring user interaction to view
- **User audio messages**: Basic audio controls with minimal visual feedback
- **Both**: Lack of clear duration display during playback
- **Assistant audio messages**: Include unnecessary advance/rewind controls that aren't needed

## Requirements

### 1. Transcription Display
- **Default State**: Transcription text should be **expanded/visible by default** for both user and assistant audio messages
- **Collapsible**: Users can still collapse the transcription if desired
- **Consistent Behavior**: Both `AudioMessage` (user) and `AssistantAudioMessage` (assistant) should behave the same way

### 2. Duration Display Enhancement
- **Current Time**: Show real-time playback position (e.g., "0:23")
- **Total Duration**: Show total duration (e.g., "1:45")
- **Format**: Display as "current:position / total:duration" (e.g., "0:23 / 1:45")
- **Live Updates**: Duration should update in real-time during playback
- **Pause State**: When paused, show the paused position

### 3. Simplified Controls
- **Play/Pause Only**: Remove any seek/advance/rewind controls
- **Focus on Core**: Only essential playback controls (play/pause button)
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual indication of play/pause state
- **Progress Indicator**: Keep the existing progress bar for visual reference (non-interactive)

### 4. Consistent UI Design
- **Visual Harmony**: Both user and assistant audio messages should have similar visual styling
- **Material Design**: Follow Material Design guidelines for audio playback components
- **Accessibility**: Ensure controls are accessible with proper semantics

## Technical Specification

### Files to Modify

#### 1. `lib/widgets/audio_message.dart` (User Audio Messages)
**Current State**: Basic audio controls with always-visible transcription
**Required Changes**:
- Add real-time duration display with format "current / total"
- Ensure transcription is expanded by default (already implemented)
- Implement collapsible transcription with expand/collapse button
- Add live position tracking during playback
- Simplify controls to play/pause only

#### 2. `lib/features/audio_assistant/widgets/assistant_audio_message.dart` (Assistant Audio Messages)
**Current State**: Advanced controls with collapsible transcription (collapsed by default)
**Required Changes**:
- Change `_isExpanded` default value from `false` to `true`
- Update duration display to show "current / total" format consistently
- Remove any seek/advance controls (keep only play/pause)
- Ensure consistent styling with user audio messages

### Implementation Details

#### Duration Display Format
```dart
String _formatCurrentDuration(Duration current, Duration total) {
  String formatTime(Duration duration) {
    String twoDigits(int n) => n.toString().padLeft(2, '0');
    final minutes = twoDigits(duration.inMinutes.remainder(60));
    final seconds = twoDigits(duration.inSeconds.remainder(60));
    return '$minutes:$seconds';
  }
  
  return '${formatTime(current)} / ${formatTime(total)}';
}
```

#### Transcription State Management
```dart
// Default to expanded
bool _isExpanded = true; // Changed from false

// Toggle function remains the same
void _toggleTranscription() {
  setState(() {
    _isExpanded = !_isExpanded;
  });
}
```

#### UI Layout Structure
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Play/Pause Button] [Waveform/Progress] │
│ [0:23 / 1:45]              [Expand ▼]   │
│                                         │
│ Transcription text here (expanded by    │
│ default, showing the full conversation  │
│ content that was transcribed)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## User Stories

### Story 1: Default Expanded Transcription
**As a** user sending or receiving audio messages  
**I want** to see the transcription text by default  
**So that** I can quickly understand the content without additional taps

### Story 2: Real-time Duration Tracking
**As a** user playing an audio message  
**I want** to see the current playback position and total duration  
**So that** I know how much content I've heard and how much remains

### Story 3: Simplified Controls
**As a** user interacting with audio messages  
**I want** simple play/pause controls without complex seeking  
**So that** I can focus on the content without UI complexity

### Story 4: Consistent Experience
**As a** user of the chat application  
**I want** consistent behavior between my audio messages and assistant responses  
**So that** I have a predictable and familiar interface

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Transcription Display
- [ ] Audio messages show transcription expanded by default
- [ ] Users can collapse/expand transcription using toggle button
- [ ] Toggle button shows appropriate icon (▼ for expanded, ▶ for collapsed)
- [ ] Behavior is consistent for both user and assistant messages

### ✅ Duration Display
- [ ] Shows current position and total duration as "current / total"
- [ ] Updates in real-time during playback
- [ ] Displays accurately when paused
- [ ] Format is consistent (MM:SS / MM:SS)

### ✅ Simplified Controls
- [ ] Only play/pause button is present
- [ ] No seek/advance/rewind controls
- [ ] Progress bar is visual-only (non-interactive)
- [ ] Play/pause state is clearly indicated

### ✅ Consistent Design
- [ ] User and assistant audio messages have similar styling
- [ ] Controls are properly aligned and sized
- [ ] Color scheme follows app theme
- [ ] Accessibility labels are present

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test duration formatting function with various inputs
- Test transcription toggle state management
- Test playback state tracking

### Integration Tests
- Test audio playback with real audio files
- Test transcription expand/collapse behavior
- Test duration updates during playback

### UI Tests
- Verify visual consistency between user and assistant messages
- Test accessibility features
- Verify responsive layout on different screen sizes

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: AudioMessage (User Messages)
1. Add duration tracking and display
2. Implement transcription toggle (default expanded)
3. Update UI layout

### Phase 2: AssistantAudioMessage
1. Change default expanded state to true
2. Simplify controls (remove unnecessary features)
3. Ensure duration display consistency

### Phase 3: Testing & Polish
1. Integration testing with both message types
2. UI consistency review
3. Performance optimization

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies required
- Uses existing `audioplayers` package
- Leverages current playback management system

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Performance Impact
- **Concern**: Real-time duration updates might affect performance
- **Mitigation**: Throttle updates to reasonable intervals (e.g., 100ms)

### Risk 2: UI Layout Issues
- **Concern**: Default expanded text might cause layout problems
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper text wrapping and container constraints

### Risk 3: User Confusion
- **Concern**: Changing default behavior might confuse existing users
- **Mitigation**: The change improves UX - most users want to see transcription immediately

## Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Increased interaction with audio messages
- **User Feedback**: Positive feedback on transcription visibility
- **Support Requests**: Reduced questions about how to view transcriptions
- **Performance**: No degradation in audio playback performance

## Future Enhancements
- Transcript search/highlighting during playback
- Speed control (1x, 1.5x, 2x)
- Bookmark/timestamp features
- Transcript export functionality
