# FT-076 Long-term Planning & Proactive Support

**Feature ID**: FT-076  
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: AI/Goal Management  
**Effort Estimate**: 4-5 weeks  
**Dependencies**: FT-074 (Proactive Persona Messaging), FT-075 (Notification System), Oracle Framework integration  
**Status**: Specification  

## Overview

Transform AI personas into long-term life planning partners that proactively support users in achieving their goals through intelligent planning, progress tracking, and contextual interventions. This system leverages the Oracle framework's trail progression system to provide personalized, proactive support that adapts to user progress and maintains momentum over extended periods.

## User Story

As a user working toward long-term goals, I want my AI personas to actively support my journey through intelligent planning, progress monitoring, and timely interventions, so that I can maintain momentum, overcome obstacles, and achieve sustainable success without losing focus or motivation.

## Problem Statement

**Current Limitations:**
- **Short-term Focus**: AI interactions are limited to immediate conversations
- **No Progress Tracking**: No systematic monitoring of long-term goal advancement
- **Reactive Support**: Users must initiate conversations to get help with challenges
- **Lack of Accountability**: No external system to maintain momentum and consistency
- **Disconnected Planning**: Goals and daily activities aren't systematically connected

**User Pain Points:**
- Difficulty maintaining momentum on long-term goals
- No systematic progress tracking or celebration of milestones
- Lack of accountability and support during challenging periods
- Goals feel disconnected from daily activities and routines
- No proactive intervention when progress stalls or obstacles arise

## Solution: Intelligent Long-term Planning & Proactive Support

### Core Concept
- **Goal Lifecycle Management**: Complete support from goal setting to achievement
- **Progress Intelligence**: AI-powered monitoring and intervention based on Oracle framework data
- **Contextual Proactivity**: Timely support based on user patterns, progress, and challenges
- **Multi-Persona Coordination**: Different personas handle different aspects of long-term support

### System Components
1. **Goal Planning Engine**: Intelligent goal setting and milestone planning
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time tracking using Oracle framework data
3. **Intervention System**: Proactive support during challenges and plateaus
4. **Milestone Celebration**: Recognition and motivation for achievements
5. **Adaptive Planning**: Dynamic adjustment of strategies based on progress

    Would you like to:
    • Review your current strategy
    • Try a different approach
    • Break down the next steps differently
    • Celebrate what you've accomplished so far
    
    Remember, plateaus are often where the real growth happens! 💪
