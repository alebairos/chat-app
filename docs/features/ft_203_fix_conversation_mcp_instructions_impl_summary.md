# FT-203: Fix Missing Conversation MCP Instructions - Implementation Summary

## Implementation Completed

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Duration**: 10 minutes  
**Files Modified**: 1  

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: FT-200 conversation database queries were implemented but AI didn't use them, causing "amnesia" behavior where AI introduced itself in every message.

**Root Cause**: Missing MCP instructions for the new FT-200 conversation commands in `assets/config/mcp_base_config.json`.

## Changes Made

### File: `assets/config/mcp_base_config.json`

#### 1. Added New Conversation MCP Commands (lines 89-121)

```json
{
  "name": "get_recent_user_messages",
  "description": "Get recent user messages for conversation continuity",
  "usage": "{\"action\": \"get_recent_user_messages\", \"limit\": 5}",
  "when_to_use": [
    "When conversation history is not available in context",
    "To understand what user has been discussing recently", 
    "For conversation continuity without persona contamination"
  ],
  "critical_rule": "Use when you need user context but want to avoid other personas' responses"
},
{
  "name": "get_current_persona_messages",
  "description": "Get your own previous responses for consistency", 
  "usage": "{\"action\": \"get_current_persona_messages\", \"limit\": 3}",
  "when_to_use": [
    "To maintain consistency with your previous responses",
    "When you need to reference what you said before",
    "For conversation continuity as the same persona"
  ],
  "critical_rule": "Use to avoid repeating introductions or contradicting yourself"
},
{
  "name": "search_conversation_context",
  "description": "Search conversation history by query and timeframe",
  "usage": "{\"action\": \"search_conversation_context\", \"query\": \"topic\", \"hours\": 24}",
  "when_to_use": [
    "User references specific topics discussed before",
    "Need to find context about particular subjects", 
    "User asks 'what did we discuss about X?'"
  ],
  "critical_rule": "Use for targeted context retrieval"
}
```

#### 2. Added Conversation Continuity Rules (lines 164-179)

```json
"conversation_continuity": {
  "title": "## ðŸ’¬ CONVERSATION CONTINUITY - FT-200",
  "description": "When conversation history is not in context, use MCP commands to maintain natural flow",
  "critical_rules": [
    "NEVER introduce yourself if you've already been talking to the user",
    "Use get_current_persona_messages to check if you've introduced yourself recently",
    "Use get_recent_user_messages to understand conversation flow", 
    "Only introduce yourself on first interaction or after explicit persona switch"
  ],
  "amnesia_prevention": {
    "title": "### ðŸ§  PREVENT AMNESIA BEHAVIOR",
    "rule": "Before responding, check if this appears to be a continuing conversation",
    "auto_query": "If no conversation context available, automatically use get_recent_user_messages",
    "introduction_logic": "Only introduce yourself if get_current_persona_messages shows no recent responses"
  }
}
```

## Expected Behavior Change

### Before Fix (Amnesia)
- **AI Response**: "oi, sou o I-There - seu reflexo que vive no Mirror Realm..."
- **Behavior**: Every response started with introduction
- **Logs**: No MCP conversation queries, only Oracle activity detection
- **User Experience**: Robotic, repetitive interactions

### After Fix (Natural Flow)
- **AI Response**: Should continue conversation naturally without re-introduction
- **Behavior**: AI will automatically query conversation context using MCP commands
- **Logs**: Should show `get_recent_user_messages` and `get_current_persona_messages` queries
- **User Experience**: Natural conversation continuity

## Technical Impact

### MCP System Integration
- **New Commands Available**: AI now knows about all 3 FT-200 conversation commands
- **Clear Usage Guidelines**: Specific when_to_use instructions for each command
- **Amnesia Prevention**: Explicit rules to prevent repetitive introductions

### System Prompt Enhancement
- **Automatic Loading**: MCP instructions are loaded into every persona's system prompt
- **Universal Application**: All personas (Oracle and non-Oracle) get these instructions
- **Consistent Behavior**: Standardized conversation continuity across all personas

## Testing Verification

### Expected Log Changes
1. **MCP Conversation Queries**: Should see `get_recent_user_messages` calls in logs
2. **Context Awareness**: AI should reference previous conversation naturally
3. **No Re-introductions**: Should not see "oi, sou o [persona]" in continuing conversations

### Test Scenarios
1. **Send "opa"** â†’ Should not get introduction, should query conversation context
2. **Continue conversation** â†’ Should maintain natural flow without persona prefix
3. **Switch personas** â†’ Should only introduce after explicit persona change

## Dependencies Resolved

- âœ… **FT-200**: Conversation History Database Queries (implemented)
- âœ… **SystemMCPService**: Conversation commands (implemented)  
- âœ… **MCP Base Config**: Instructions (now implemented)
- âœ… **Feature Toggle**: Conversation database config (enabled)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**: Send messages and verify natural conversation flow
2. **Monitor logs**: Check for MCP conversation queries
3. **Validate behavior**: Ensure no repetitive introductions
4. **Performance check**: Monitor MCP query performance and frequency
