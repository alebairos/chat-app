# PRD: Test Stabilization and Mock Simplification

## Document Information
- **Feature ID**: FT-017
- **Document Type**: PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2024-12-19
- **Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

This PRD addresses critical issues in the test suite including compilation errors, hanging tests, and overly complex mocking strategies. The goal is to create a stable, maintainable test suite that follows simple testing principles.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues

1. **Compilation Errors**
   - Method signature mismatches in mock classes (e.g., `generateAudio` method)
   - Mock classes not properly implementing interface changes
   - Test files failing to compile due to outdated mocks

2. **Hanging Tests**
   - Character selection tests timing out with `pumpAndSettle()`
   - Widget tests getting stuck in infinite animation loops
   - Tests that never complete execution

3. **Complex Mocking**
   - Overly sophisticated mock implementations
   - Mocks that are harder to maintain than the actual code
   - Inconsistent mocking patterns across test files

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Eliminate all compilation errors** in the test suite
- **Fix hanging tests** by simplifying widget test approaches
- **Simplify mocking strategy** to follow "very focused, simple, no mocks needed" principle
- **Achieve 100% test pass rate** for non-skipped tests

### Secondary Goals
- Improve test maintainability
- Reduce test execution time
- Establish consistent testing patterns

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Compilation Error Resolution
- **FR-1.1**: Fix method signature mismatches in mock classes
- **FR-1.2**: Update mock implementations to match current interfaces
- **FR-1.3**: Ensure all test files compile successfully

#### FR-2: Hanging Test Resolution
- **FR-2.1**: Replace `pumpAndSettle()` with more targeted approaches in widget tests
- **FR-2.2**: Implement timeout mechanisms for potentially long-running tests
- **FR-2.3**: Skip or mark as integration tests any tests that require complex UI interactions

#### FR-3: Mock Simplification
- **FR-3.1**: Reduce mock complexity to essential functionality only
- **FR-3.2**: Prefer real implementations over mocks where possible
- **FR-3.3**: Use simple stub implementations instead of complex mock frameworks

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR-1: Test Execution Performance
- Individual test execution should complete within 30 seconds
- Full test suite should complete within 5 minutes
- No tests should hang indefinitely

#### NFR-2: Maintainability
- Mock classes should be simpler than the classes they mock
- Test code should be self-explanatory
- Consistent patterns across all test files

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (Priority: Critical)

#### 1.1 Fix Compilation Errors
```dart
// Example: Fix generateAudio method signature
class MockAudioAssistantTTSService extends Mock implements AudioAssistantTTSService {
  @override
  Future<String?> generateAudio(String text, {String? language}) async {
    // Simple implementation
  }
}
```

#### 1.2 Address Hanging Tests
- Replace `pumpAndSettle()` with `pump()` and specific waits
- Add explicit timeouts to widget tests
- Skip tests that require complex UI state management

#### 1.3 Simplify Mocks
- Remove complex mock behavior
- Use simple return values instead of complex state management
- Prefer dependency injection of simple test doubles

### Phase 2: Test Strategy Refinement (Priority: High)

#### 2.1 Categorize Tests
- **Unit Tests**: Simple, fast, no mocks needed
- **Integration Tests**: Real dependencies, controlled environment
- **Widget Tests**: Minimal mocking, focused on specific widgets
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full application flow (separate from unit tests)

#### 2.2 Mock Strategy Guidelines
- **Default**: No mocks, use real implementations
- **When needed**: Simple stub implementations
- **Last resort**: Mock frameworks with minimal setup

### Phase 3: Test Stabilization (Priority: Medium)

#### 3.1 Consistent Patterns
- Standardize test structure across all files
- Use helper functions for common test setup
- Implement consistent assertion patterns

#### 3.2 Performance Optimization
- Parallel test execution where possible
- Efficient test data setup
- Minimal test environment initialization

## Implementation Plan

### Sprint 1: Critical Fixes
- [ ] Fix all compilation errors in mock classes
- [ ] Update method signatures to match current interfaces
- [ ] Ensure all test files compile

### Sprint 2: Hanging Test Resolution
- [ ] Identify and fix all hanging widget tests
- [ ] Implement timeout mechanisms
- [ ] Skip problematic tests with clear documentation

### Sprint 3: Mock Simplification
- [ ] Refactor complex mocks to simple implementations
- [ ] Remove unnecessary mock frameworks where possible
- [ ] Implement consistent mocking patterns

### Sprint 4: Validation and Documentation
- [ ] Achieve 100% test pass rate for non-skipped tests
- [ ] Document testing patterns and guidelines
- [ ] Create test maintenance procedures

## Success Criteria

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Zero compilation errors** in test suite
2. **Zero hanging tests** (all tests complete within timeout)
3. **90%+ test pass rate** for non-skipped tests
4. **Test suite completes** within 5 minutes
5. **Simplified mocks** that are easier to maintain than original code

### Quality Gates
- All tests must compile successfully
- No test should hang for more than 30 seconds
- Mock classes should have fewer lines of code than the classes they mock
- Test code should be self-documenting

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Widget tests complexity**: Some UI tests may be inherently complex
- **Test environment dependencies**: External dependencies may cause flakiness

### Medium Risk
- **Mock simplification impact**: Removing mocks may expose real bugs
- **Test coverage reduction**: Skipping hanging tests may reduce coverage

### Mitigation Strategies
- Gradual mock simplification with validation
- Clear documentation of skipped tests and reasons
- Focus on critical path testing over comprehensive coverage

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Flutter test framework
- Mocktail package (simplified usage)
- Test helper utilities

### Team Dependencies
- Development team for interface changes
- QA team for test validation
- DevOps team for CI/CD pipeline updates

## Conclusion

This PRD provides a structured approach to fixing the test suite issues while establishing sustainable testing practices. The focus on simplicity over complexity will lead to more maintainable and reliable tests.

The phased approach ensures critical issues are addressed first while building toward a more robust testing strategy that aligns with the project's "very focused, simple, no mocks needed" philosophy.
