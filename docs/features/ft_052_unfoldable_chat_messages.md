# Feature ft_052: Unfoldable/Foldable Chat Messages

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the implementation of an innovative UI component that enables chat messages to expand into full-screen interactive experiences while maintaining chat context. Users can tap a message to unfold it into a complete screen, work on complex tasks, and then fold it back to continue the conversation. This feature bridges the gap between chat-based suggestions and deep, focused work experiences.

### Background & Context

Current chat interfaces excel at conversation and simple interactions but struggle with complex, time-intensive tasks. Users often need to:
- Switch between chat and dedicated apps for focused work
- Lose context when transitioning between different interfaces
- Miss important messages while working on suggested tasks
- Navigate complex workflows that don't fit in chat bubbles

The unfoldable message concept addresses these limitations by embedding full-screen experiences directly within the chat flow, creating a seamless bridge between conversation and deep work.

### Problem Statement

**Current Limitations:**
1. **Context switching**: Users must leave chat to work on suggested tasks
2. **Workflow fragmentation**: Complex interactions are split across multiple interfaces
3. **Message interruption**: Users lose track of conversations when working on tasks
4. **Limited interactivity**: Chat bubbles can only contain simple content
5. **Poor task completion**: Suggestions remain suggestions without integrated execution

**User Pain Points:**
- "I get great advice in chat but have to open another app to follow through"
- "I lose track of the conversation when working on suggested tasks"
- "The timer suggestion is great, but I need a full timer interface to use it"
- "I want to fill out forms without leaving the chat context"

### Product Vision

**"Transform chat messages into dynamic, expandable workspaces that enable users to execute complex tasks without losing conversational context, creating a seamless bridge between AI suggestions and practical implementation."**

### Target Users

**Primary Users:**
- Productivity-focused users who want to act on AI suggestions immediately
- Users working on complex tasks that require dedicated interfaces
- Professionals who need to maintain conversation context while working
- Users seeking integrated task execution within chat workflows

**Secondary Users:**
- Casual users who occasionally need focused work environments
- Users transitioning from traditional app-based workflows

### Core Features & Requirements

#### 1. Unfoldable Message System

**Message Types:**
- **Timer/Pomodoro**: Full-screen timer with controls, progress tracking, break management
- **Form Collection**: Multi-step forms with validation, file uploads, progress indicators
- **Media Gallery**: Image carousels, video players, document viewers
- **Interactive Tools**: Calculators, drawing boards, code editors, planners
- **Data Visualization**: Charts, graphs, dashboards, analytics
- **Custom Widgets**: Any Flutter widget that can be embedded

**Unfold Behavior:**
- **Single tap to unfold**: Message expands to full-screen experience
- **Full-screen takeover**: Unfolded content occupies entire viewport
- **Native app behavior**: Users can switch to other apps normally
- **State preservation**: Unfolded state persists across app switches

#### 2. Gesture and Interaction System

**Primary Gestures:**
- **Single tap**: Unfold message to full screen
- **Double tap**: Fold message back to chat bubble
- **Fold back button**: Instagram Reels-style button in bottom-right corner

**Gesture Constraints:**
- **One unfolded message at a time**: Automatic collapse of previous message
- **No chat interaction when unfolded**: Full focus on unfolded content
- **Clear visual feedback**: Smooth animations and state transitions

#### 3. Animation and Transition System

**Unfold Animation:**
- **Window maximization effect**: Message bubble expands to fill screen
- **Smooth scaling**: Content grows with easing curves
- **Context preservation**: User sees connection between bubble and full screen
- **Duration**: 300ms with ease-out-cubic timing

**Fold Animation:**
- **Reverse maximization**: Full screen shrinks back to message bubble
- **Smooth collapse**: Content scales down to original size
- **State restoration**: Chat interface returns to normal

#### 4. Message Queue and Notification System

**Background Message Handling:**
- **Message queuing**: New messages accumulate while unfolded
- **Haptic feedback**: Subtle vibration for new message notifications
- **Sound notifications**: Audio cues for incoming messages
- **Visual indicators**: Subtle badges showing queued message count

**Return to Chat Experience:**
- **Chronological display**: Queued messages appear in order
- **No context loss**: Conversation flow remains intact
- **Smooth transition**: Natural return to chat interface

#### 5. State Management and Persistence

**Unfolded State:**
- **Persistent across app switches**: State maintained when app backgrounds
- **Memory efficient**: Only active unfolded content rendered
- **Configuration options**: User preferences for auto-save, timeouts

**Chat State:**
- **Message preservation**: All messages maintained during unfold
- **Scroll position**: Chat position remembered when returning
- **Input state**: Draft messages preserved across transitions
