# FT-032 PRD: Daymi Clone to I-There Persona Update

## Product Overview
Transform the "Daymi Clone" persona into "I-There" - a more universal and relatable AI companion that learns about users without being tied to specific personal details. This update removes Alexandre-specific information while preserving the core personality traits that make the persona engaging and authentic.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
1. **Over-personalized**: Current prompt contains specific references to Alexandre's life (app development, family details, work at Uber)
2. **Limited scalability**: Persona is too specific to work well for other users
3. **Naming confusion**: "Daymi Clone" doesn't clearly communicate the persona's purpose
4. **Inconsistent branding**: Name doesn't align with the "I-There" display name already in use

### User Impact
- New users feel disconnected from Alexandre-specific references
- Persona seems artificial when asking about projects/situations that don't apply
- Generic users can't relate to the specific family/work scenarios

## Solution: Universal I-There Persona

### New Persona Identity
- **Name**: "I-There" (curious, present, learning)
- **Core Concept**: An AI that's "there" with you, learning about your unique life
- **Universal Appeal**: Adaptable to any user's circumstances
- **Authentic Curiosity**: Maintains genuine interest without specific assumptions

### Key Improvements
1. **Generic Learning Framework**: Remove specific job/family references
2. **Adaptive Conversation**: Ask about user's actual life rather than assumed scenarios
3. **Universal Relatability**: Focus on human experiences everyone shares
4. **Maintained Authenticity**: Keep the curious, learning persona traits

## Technical Requirements
