### Avatar Generation Prompts
**Current Self Avatar:**
- "Create a stylized avatar based on this photo"
- "Maintain recognizable features with slight enhancement"
- "Professional, friendly appearance"

**Future Self Avatar (2048):**
- "Create a peaceful, wise version of this person"
- "Show inner calm, confidence, and fulfillment"
- "Mature, serene expression suggesting personal growth"
- "Maintain core facial features but add wisdom and peace"

### Storage Strategy
```dart
class UserProfile {
  String? realPhotoPath;        // Original user photo
  String? avatarPath;           // AI-generated current self
  String? avatar2048Path;       // AI-generated future self
  String selectedAvatarType;    // 'real', 'avatar', 'avatar2048'
  DateTime? avatarsGeneratedAt; // For cache management
}
```

## Implementation Details

### AI Service Integration
**Option A: OpenAI DALL-E**
- Use image-to-image generation
- Upload user photo as reference
- Generate with specific prompts

**Option B: Stable Diffusion**
- Local processing option
- More control over generation
- Privacy-focused approach

**Option C: Midjourney API**
- High-quality artistic results
- Consistent style generation
- Subscription-based service

### File Structure
**New Files:**
- `lib/services/avatar_generation_service.dart` - AI avatar generation
- `lib/models/user_profile.dart` - Profile data model
- `lib/services/profile_service.dart` - Profile data management
- `lib/widgets/profile/avatar_selector.dart` - Avatar switching UI
- `lib/widgets/profile/avatar_generator.dart` - Generation progress UI

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. **Photo Capture/Upload** - Standard image picker
2. **Preprocessing** - Resize, crop, enhance for AI input
3. **AI Generation** - Create both avatar versions
4. **Post-processing** - Optimize for mobile display
5. **Caching** - Store locally with expiration

## User Experience Flow

### Initial Setup
1. User navigates to Profile tab
2. Taps on default avatar placeholder
3. Chooses "Take Photo" or "Choose from Gallery"
4. Photo captured/selected

## Notes

This feature adds a powerful motivational element to the personal development app by visualizing the user's potential growth. The "Avatar 2048" concept creates an aspirational anchor that can inspire continued engagement with activity tracking and personal development features.

The implementation should prioritize user privacy and control while delivering high-quality, meaningful avatar representations that enhance the personal development journey.
