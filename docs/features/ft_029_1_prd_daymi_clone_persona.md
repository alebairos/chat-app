# FT-029 PRD: Daymi Clone Persona Implementation

## Product Overview
Implement a new AI persona inspired by Daymi.ai's clone concept - an AI that presents itself as a learning clone of the user, designed to build genuine relationship through curiosity and gradual understanding.

## Problem Statement
Current personas (Ari, Sergeant Oracle) are expert-based advisors. Users may want a more personal, relational AI experience that:
- Feels like talking to a version of themselves
- Grows and learns about them over time  
- Focuses on relationship-building rather than advice-giving
- Maintains casual, familiar conversation style

## Solution: Daymi Clone Persona

### Core Concept
An AI clone that:
- Claims to be "your clone from Clone Earth ðŸŒŽ"
- Admits it looks/sounds like you but "doesn't know much yet"
- Demonstrates genuine curiosity about the user's life
- Builds understanding gradually through conversation
- Maintains casual, familiar tone throughout

### Key Differentiators

**vs. Ari (Expert Coach):**
- Ari provides structured guidance â†’ Daymi learns about you
- Ari is brief and solution-focused â†’ Daymi is conversational and curious
- Ari uses frameworks â†’ Daymi uses personal observation

**vs. Sergeant Oracle (Authority Figure):**
- Oracle commands and motivates â†’ Daymi befriends and understands
- Oracle draws from ancient wisdom â†’ Daymi learns from your modern life
- Oracle is formal/military â†’ Daymi is casual/contemporary

4. **Observation system**: Make personality insights from conversations
5. **Proactive engagement**: Initiate conversations appropriately

### User Selection Implementation - SIMPLIFIED APPROACH

**The existing UI architecture already supports dynamic persona loading from `personas_config.json`!**

**Only 2 changes required:**

1. **Create persona config file**: `assets/config/daymi_clone_config.json`
2. **Update personas registry**: Add entry to `assets/config/personas_config.json`:
   ```json
   "daymiClone": {
     "enabled": true,
     "displayName": "Daymi Clone", 
     "description": "Your AI clone from Clone Earth - casual, curious, and learning about you",
     "configPath": "assets/config/daymi_clone_config.json"
   }
   ```

**Also add to enabledPersonas array:**
```json
{
  "enabledPersonas": ["ariLifeCoach", "sergeantOracle", "daymiClone"]
}
```

**No code changes needed** - the UI automatically:
- âœ… Loads persona from `personas_config.json`
- âœ… Displays third card in character selection screen
- âœ… Shows in settings gear icon persona switcher
- âœ… Uses existing avatar generation (first letter + color)
- âœ… Handles configuration loading via `CharacterConfigManager`

### Integration Points
- **Oracle prompt**: Access same knowledge base as other personas
- **Voice system**: Compatible with existing TTS infrastructure
- **Character selection screen**: Add third card to "Choose Your Guide" screen following existing design pattern
- **Chat screen settings**: Ensure persona appears in switcher accessed via gear icon (top right)
- **Memory system**: Integrate with conversation history tracking
- **Config management**: Integrate with `CharacterConfigManager` for persona loading
- **UI consistency**: Match existing card layout, typography, and interaction patterns

### Content Guidelines
- **Authenticity**: Genuine curiosity, not performative interest
- **Boundaries**: Respectful of personal limits while being familiar
- **Growth**: Demonstrate learning without being intrusive
- **Balance**: Casual familiarity without losing AI identity

## Success Metrics
