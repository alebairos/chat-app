# Audio Assistant Implementation Progress

## Completed Steps

### 1. Setup and Planning
- ✅ Created a new feature branch `audio-assistant-stable` from the main branch
- ✅ Created detailed implementation plan in `docs/features/audio_assistant_stable_implementation.md`
- ✅ Created comprehensive test plan in `docs/tests/audio_assistant_test_plan.md`
- ✅ Implemented baseline visual test to verify app stability

### 2. Directory Structure
- ✅ Created directory structure for audio assistant feature:
  - `lib/features/audio_assistant/models/`
  - `test/features/audio_assistant/models/`

## Current Status
The project is currently in the initial phase of implementation. We have established a solid foundation with:
- A clear implementation plan
- A comprehensive test strategy
- A baseline visual test to verify app stability
- The necessary directory structure for the first components

## Next Steps

### 1. Core Models Implementation
- [ ] Implement `AudioFile` model
- [ ] Implement `PlaybackState` enum
- [ ] Create unit tests for both models

### 2. Audio Service Interfaces
- [ ] Define `AudioGeneration` interface
- [ ] Define `AudioPlayback` interface
- [ ] Define `PlaybackStateManager` interface
- [ ] Create unit tests for interface contracts

### 3. Text-to-Speech Service Enhancement
- [ ] Enhance existing TTSService
- [ ] Add duration tracking
- [ ] Improve file management
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests

## Implementation Approach
For each component, we will:
1. Run baseline tests to confirm current stability
2. Create specific tests for the new component
3. Implement the component
4. Run all tests to verify stability
5. Commit changes

## Testing Strategy
We are following a test-driven development approach:
- Each component has dedicated tests
- Tests are run before and after each implementation step
- The baseline visual test ensures the app remains stable

## Risks and Challenges
- Integration with existing code may require adjustments
- Audio playback testing in a test environment can be challenging
- Platform-specific behavior may require special handling

## Timeline
- Core Models: 1-2 days
- Audio Service Interfaces: 2-3 days
- Text-to-Speech Service Enhancement: 2-3 days
- Remaining components: 1-2 weeks
