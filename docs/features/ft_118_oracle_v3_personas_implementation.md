# FT-118: Oracle v3.0 and Personas 3.0 Implementation

**Feature ID:** FT-118  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** Core Feature  
**Effort:** 2-3 days  

## Problem Statement

Need to implement Oracle v3.0 with enhanced Aristos Life Management Coach framework and create corresponding 3.0 personas to provide users with advanced behavioral change methodologies and comprehensive habit tracking systems.

## Current State

- Oracle 2.1 with basic life coaching framework
- Limited onboarding pathways
- Basic habit recommendations
- Three persona types (Ari, I-There, Sergeant Oracle) with 2.1 versions

## Proposed Solution

### Oracle v3.0 Enhancements

1. **Comprehensive Behavioral Framework**
   - Integration of 9 scientific methodologies (BJ Fogg, Anna Lembke, Huberman, etc.)
   - Structured 5-step onboarding process
   - Three pathway options: Goals-First, Habit Elimination, Routine Optimization

2. **Complete Habit Catalog System**
   - 800+ structured habit interventions
   - Progressive trilha (track) system with difficulty levels
   - Specialized protocols by life pillar (Energy, Skills, Connection)
   - OKR-based goal setting methodology

3. **Advanced Coaching Methodologies**
   - MEEDDS strategy (Meditation, Exercise, Eating, Digital Detox, Deep Sleep, Stillness)
   - PLOW framework (Planning, Learning, Orchestration, Work)
   - GLOWS approach (Gratitude, Love, Orchestration, Willingness, Spirituality)

### Personas 3.0 Implementation

1. **Aristos 3.0** (`ariWithOracle30`)
   - Advanced Life Management Coach
   - Full behavioral change framework integration
   - Structured onboarding and habit catalog access

2. **I-There 3.0** (`iThereWithOracle30`)
   - Mirror realm AI reflection enhanced with Aristos framework
   - Advanced behavioral science integration
   - Habit transformation systems

3. **Sergeant Oracle 3.0** (`sergeantOracleWithOracle30`)
   - Roman gladiator coach with cutting-edge behavioral science
   - Ancient wisdom meets modern methodology
   - Epic life transformation approach

## Implementation Tasks

1. Create `oracle_prompt_v3.md` with comprehensive Aristos framework
2. Update `personas_config.json` with 3.0 persona configurations
3. Set default persona to `iThereWithOracle30`
4. Generate JSON preprocessing from markdown using existing Python script
5. Test persona loading and Oracle integration
6. Verify MCP instructions compatibility

## Benefits

- [ ] JSON preprocessing generates correctly
- [ ] All personas load Oracle v3.0 content
- [ ] MCP activity tracking instructions preserved
- [ ] Onboarding pathways functional
- [ ] Habit catalog accessible through personas

## Dependencies
