# FT-026: TestFlight Distribution Setup

**Feature Type**: DevOps/Distribution Enhancement  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Planning  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours  

## Problem Statement

Currently, the chat app can only be deployed to physical iOS devices that have Developer Mode enabled, which creates barriers for team testing and distribution:

### Current Pain Points
1. **Developer Mode Requirement**: Team members must enable Developer Mode on personal devices
2. **Manual Distribution**: No streamlined way to distribute builds to testers
3. **Limited Testing**: Only developers with proper setup can test on physical devices
4. **No Version Control**: No organized way to track distributed builds
5. **Security Concerns**: Requiring Developer Mode may make team members uncomfortable

### Target Users
- **Development Team**: Easier testing and validation
- **Product Team**: Access to builds for review and feedback
- **QA Team**: Streamlined testing process on real devices
- **Stakeholders**: Demo access without technical setup

## Solution Overview

Implement **TestFlight distribution** through Apple's official beta testing platform, enabling:

1. **Professional Distribution**: Official Apple-approved beta testing
2. **No Developer Mode Required**: Team members install like regular App Store apps
3. **Automated Build Pipeline**: CI/CD integration for seamless releases
4. **Version Management**: Organized build tracking and release notes
5. **User Management**: Control over who can access which builds

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Apple Developer Account Setup

#### Prerequisites
- **Apple Developer Program Membership** ($99/year)
- **Team Agent/Admin Role** for TestFlight access
- **App Bundle ID** registered in Developer Portal
- **Provisioning Profiles** for distribution

#### App Store Connect Configuration
```
App Store Connect Requirements:
├── App Registration
│   ├── Bundle ID: com.yourcompany.chatapp
│   ├── App Name: "Chat App"
│   └── App Category: Productivity/Social Networking
├── TestFlight Setup
│   ├── Internal Testing Groups
│   ├── External Testing Groups  
│   └── Build Processing Configuration
└── Team Management
    ├── Developer Roles
    ├── Tester Invitations
    └── Access Permissions
```

### 2. Build Configuration

#### Xcode Project Setup
- **Archive Configuration**: Release build settings
- **Code Signing**: Distribution certificates and profiles
- **Info.plist**: Version numbers and build configurations
- **Capabilities**: Ensure all required capabilities are enabled

#### Build Script Integration
```bash
# Example build pipeline
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/build_for_testflight.sh

# Clean and prepare
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build iOS archive
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign

# Archive with Xcode
xcodebuild -workspace ios/Runner.xcworkspace \
           -scheme Runner \
           -configuration Release \
           -destination generic/platform=iOS \
           -archivePath build/Runner.xcarchive \
           archive

# Export for App Store distribution
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
           -archivePath build/Runner.xcarchive \
           -exportPath build/ios_distribution \
           -exportOptionsPlist ios/ExportOptions.plist
```

### 3. Automated Distribution Pipeline

#### CI/CD Integration Options

**Option A: GitHub Actions**
```yaml
name: TestFlight Distribution
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      release_notes:
        description: 'Release notes for this build'
        required: true

jobs:
  build_and_distribute:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      - name: Build iOS
        run: scripts/build_for_testflight.sh
      - name: Upload to TestFlight
        uses: apple-actions/upload-testflight-build@v1
        with:
          app-path: build/ios_distribution/Runner.ipa
          issuer-id: ${{ secrets.APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID }}
          api-key-id: ${{ secrets.APPSTORE_API_KEY_ID }}
          api-private-key: ${{ secrets.APPSTORE_API_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

**Option B: Manual Upload Process**
1. Build archive locally
2. Upload via Xcode Organizer
3. Process build in App Store Connect
4. Distribute to test groups

### 4. Team Management Structure

#### Testing Groups
```
Internal Testing (No Review Required):
├── Development Team (5-10 people)
│   ├── Lead Developer
│   ├── Mobile Developers
│   └── QA Engineers
└── Product Team (3-5 people)
    ├── Product Manager
    ├── UX Designer
    └── Stakeholders

External Testing (Apple Review Required):
├── Beta Testers (up to 10,000)
├── Client Representatives
└── Focus Groups
```

#### Access Control
- **Internal Group**: Immediate access to all builds
- **External Group**: Controlled rollout with Apple review
- **Version Control**: Different groups can test different versions
- **Feedback Collection**: Built-in TestFlight feedback mechanisms

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (2-3 hours)
1. **Apple Developer Account Verification**
   - Confirm active membership
   - Verify team roles and permissions
   - Register app bundle ID if not exists

2. **App Store Connect Configuration**
   - Create app listing in App Store Connect
   - Configure TestFlight settings
   - Set up internal testing groups

3. **Xcode Project Configuration**
   - Configure distribution certificates
   - Set up provisioning profiles
   - Test manual archive and upload

### Phase 2: Automation Setup (1-2 hours)
1. **Build Scripts**
   - Create automated build script
   - Configure export options
   - Test local build pipeline

2. **CI/CD Integration** (Optional)
   - Set up GitHub Actions or preferred CI
   - Configure secrets and credentials
   - Test automated deployment

### Phase 3: Team Onboarding (30 minutes)
1. **Tester Invitations**
   - Add team members to internal group
   - Send TestFlight invitations
   - Provide installation instructions

2. **Process Documentation**
   - Create testing workflow guide
   - Document feedback collection process
   - Establish release communication

## Distribution Workflow

### For Developers
```bash
# 1. Prepare release
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3

# 2. Build and upload (manual)
scripts/build_for_testflight.sh
# OR trigger automated pipeline

# 3. Manage distribution
# - Review build in App Store Connect
# - Add release notes
# - Distribute to test groups
```

### For Testers
```
1. Receive TestFlight invitation email
2. Install TestFlight app from App Store
3. Tap invitation link or enter invite code
4. Install beta app (no Developer Mode needed)
5. Provide feedback through TestFlight
```

## Required Files and Configuration

### 1. Export Options Plist
```xml
<!-- ios/ExportOptions.plist -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>destination</key>
    <string>export</string>
    <key>method</key>
    <string>app-store</string>
    <key>teamID</key>
    <string>YOUR_TEAM_ID</string>
    <key>uploadBitcode</key>
    <false/>
    <key>uploadSymbols</key>
    <true/>
    <key>compileBitcode</key>
    <false/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### 2. Build Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/build_for_testflight.sh
set -e

echo "🏗️  Building Chat App for TestFlight..."

# Environment setup
export FLUTTER_ROOT=$(flutter doctor -v | grep "Flutter version" | awk '{print $6}')
export PATH="$FLUTTER_ROOT/bin:$PATH"

# Clean and prepare
echo "🧹 Cleaning project..."
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build iOS
echo "📱 Building iOS release..."
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign

# Archive
echo "📦 Creating archive..."
xcodebuild -workspace ios/Runner.xcworkspace \
           -scheme Runner \
           -configuration Release \
           -destination generic/platform=iOS \
           -archivePath build/Runner.xcarchive \
           archive

# Export
echo "📤 Exporting for distribution..."
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
           -archivePath build/Runner.xcarchive \
           -exportPath build/ios_distribution \
           -exportOptionsPlist ios/ExportOptions.plist

echo "✅ Build complete! IPA location: build/ios_distribution/Runner.ipa"
echo "📝 Next steps:"
echo "   1. Upload to App Store Connect via Xcode Organizer or Transporter"
echo "   2. Process build and add release notes"
echo "   3. Distribute to test groups"
```

### 3. Version Management
```dart
// lib/config/version.dart
class AppVersion {
  static const String version = '1.2.3';
  static const String buildNumber = '123';
  static const String buildDate = '2025-01-27';
  
  static String get fullVersion => '$version ($buildNumber)';
  static String get displayVersion => 'v$version';
}
```
