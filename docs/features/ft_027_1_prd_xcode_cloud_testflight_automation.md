# FT-027: Xcode Cloud + TestFlight Automation

**Feature Type**: DevOps/CI-CD Enhancement  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Planning  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours setup  

## Problem Statement

Manual app distribution to team members is cumbersome and creates barriers:

### Current Pain Points
1. **Manual builds**: Developer needs to build and export manually
2. **Local dependencies**: Requires Xcode on specific machine
3. **Developer Mode requirement**: Team members need technical setup
4. **No automation**: No integration with git workflow
5. **Inconsistent distribution**: Manual process prone to errors

### Desired Outcome
- **Push to branch** → **Automatic TestFlight build** → **Team notification**
- Zero manual intervention after initial setup
- Professional app distribution without technical barriers

## Solution Overview

Implement **Xcode Cloud + TestFlight automation** pipeline:

```
GitHub Branch Push → Xcode Cloud Build → TestFlight Distribution → Team Notification
```

### Architecture
```
Developer Workflow:
├── 1. Push to `release/testflight` branch
├── 2. Xcode Cloud triggers automatically
├── 3. Cloud builds iOS app in Apple's infrastructure
├── 4. Automatic TestFlight upload and processing
├── 5. Team members get TestFlight notification
└── 6. Install without Developer Mode

Technical Stack:
├── Xcode Cloud (Apple's CI/CD)
├── TestFlight (Apple's beta distribution)
├── GitHub integration
└── App Store Connect automation
```

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Apple Developer Setup

#### Prerequisites
- **Apple Developer Program** ($99/year)
- **App Store Connect** access with admin rights
- **Xcode Cloud** subscription (included with Developer Program)
- **Bundle ID** registered for the app

#### App Store Connect Configuration
```
App Store Connect Setup:
├── App Registration
│   ├── Bundle ID: com.yourcompany.chatapp
│   ├── App Name: "Chat App"
│   └── App Store listing (basic info)
├── Xcode Cloud Configuration
│   ├── GitHub repository connection
│   ├── Workflow triggers (branch-based)
│   └── Build environment settings
└── TestFlight Setup
    ├── Internal testing groups
    ├── External testing groups (optional)
    └── Automatic distribution settings
```

### 2. GitHub Repository Setup

#### Branch Strategy
```
Git Workflow:
├── main (production)
├── develop (active development)
├── release/testflight (automatic TestFlight builds)
└── feature/* (feature branches)

Trigger Logic:
- Push to `release/testflight` → Build + Deploy
- Tag like `v1.2.3-beta` → Build + Deploy  
- Manual trigger option in App Store Connect
```

#### Required Files
```
Repository Structure:
├── .xcode-cloud/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── testflight-deploy.yml
├── ios/
│   ├── Runner.xcworkspace
│   ├── ExportOptions.plist
│   └── Runner/Info.plist
└── ci_scripts/
    ├── ci_post_clone.sh
    └── ci_pre_xcodebuild.sh
```

### 3. Xcode Cloud Workflow Configuration

#### Workflow Definition
```yaml
# .xcode-cloud/workflows/testflight-deploy.yml
name: TestFlight Deploy
description: Automatic TestFlight build and distribution

trigger:
  branch: release/testflight
  
environment:
  xcode: 15.4

    distribute:
      testflight:
        groups: ["Internal Testers", "Development Team"]
        notes: "Automatic build from $CI_BRANCH_NAME"
```

#### Build Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh
# Runs after Xcode Cloud clones the repo

echo "Installing Flutter..."
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
export PATH="$PWD/flutter/bin:$PATH"

echo "Setting up Flutter project..."
flutter doctor
flutter pub get
flutter precache --ios

echo "Flutter setup complete"
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash  
# ci_scripts/ci_pre_xcodebuild.sh
# Runs before Xcode build

echo "Preparing Flutter build..."
export PATH="$PWD/flutter/bin:$PATH"

# Build Flutter for iOS
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign

echo "Flutter build complete, starting Xcode archive..."
```

### 4. Automated TestFlight Distribution

   - Authorize GitHub access
   - Select repository and branch
2. **Create build workflow**
   - Configure triggers (branch/tag based)
   - Set up Flutter environment
   - Configure TestFlight distribution
3. **Test manual trigger**
   - Verify build completes successfully
   - Confirm TestFlight upload works

### Phase 3: Automation Setup (30 minutes)
1. **Create release branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/testflight
   git push origin release/testflight
   ```
2. **Test automatic trigger**
   - Make small change and push
   - Verify build triggers automatically
   - Confirm team receives TestFlight notification
3. **Document workflow for team**

## Developer Workflow

### For Developers
```bash
# 1. Prepare release
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 2. Create release branch
git checkout -b release/testflight
git push origin release/testflight

# 3. Wait for automatic build (10-15 minutes)
# 4. Team gets TestFlight notification automatically
# 5. Test and gather feedback
# 6. Merge to main when ready
```

### For Team Members
```
1. Install TestFlight app from App Store (one-time)
2. Accept invitation email (one-time) 
3. Get automatic notifications for new builds
4. Tap notification → Install latest version
5. Provide feedback through TestFlight
```

## Benefits and Value

flutter doctor -v
flutter --version

# Set up project
flutter pub get
flutter precache --ios

echo "✅ Flutter setup complete"
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ci_scripts/ci_pre_xcodebuild.sh

set -e

echo "🏗️ Building Flutter iOS app..."

# Set Flutter path
export PATH="$PWD/flutter_sdk/bin:$PATH"

# Build iOS app
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign

echo "✅ Flutter build complete"
```

### 3. Version Management
```dart
// lib/config/build_info.dart
class BuildInfo {
  static const String version = String.fromEnvironment('APP_VERSION', defaultValue: '1.0.0');
  static const String buildNumber = String.fromEnvironment('BUILD_NUMBER', defaultValue: '1');
  static const String buildBranch = String.fromEnvironment('CI_BRANCH_NAME', defaultValue: 'unknown');
