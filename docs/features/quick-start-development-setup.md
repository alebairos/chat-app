- **Documentation**: Check `/docs` folder for detailed guides
- **Issues**: Create GitHub issues for bugs
- **Team Lead**: Contact @[team-lead] for access issues

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make changes and test on device
3. Run tests: `flutter test`
4. Create pull request
5. Deploy to staging for team testing

## Advanced Setup (Optional)

### Multiple Environment Support
```bash
# Run with different flavors (when implemented)
flutter run --flavor development
flutter run --flavor staging
