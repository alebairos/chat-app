# FT-061 Oracle Activity Memory - Implementation Summary

## Implementation Overview

Successfully implemented FT-061 Oracle Activity Memory, providing AI personas with long-term memory for user activities and habits. The implementation includes dynamic parsing of Oracle framework activities from persona configurations, basic activity detection, and structured storage with contextual injection.

## Components Implemented

### 1. OracleActivityParser Service
**File:** `lib/services/oracle_activity_parser.dart`

- **Dynamic parsing** of Oracle activities and dimensions from persona markdown files
- **Zero hardcoding** - all activity definitions extracted from `oracle_prompt_2.1.md`
- **Caching mechanism** for performance optimization
- **Handles Oracle 2.1 inconsistencies** (activities in trilhas not in main library)
- **Graceful fallback** when Oracle configs are unavailable

**Key Features:**
- Parses dimensions (SF, SM, R, E, T) with Portuguese names
- Extracts library activities with codes and descriptions
- Identifies trilha-specific activities for completeness
- Provides structured data models for consumption

### 2. ActivityModel (Isar Database Model)
**File:** `lib/models/activity_model.dart`

- **Structured storage** for tracked activities in local Isar database
- **Time-aware** fields leveraging FT-060 precise time awareness
- **Oracle integration** with activity codes and dimensions
- **Confidence scoring** for AI-detected activities
- **Metadata fields** for source tracking and notes

**Key Fields:**
- `activityCode`, `activityName`, `dimension` for Oracle activities
- `completedAt` with precise timestamp from FT-060
- `confidence` for detection reliability scoring
- `source` tracking (Oracle vs Custom activities)
- `dayOfWeek`, `timeOfDay` for temporal patterns

### 3. ActivityMemoryService
**File:** `lib/services/activity_memory_service.dart`

- **Activity logging** with automatic timestamp generation
- **Contextual retrieval** by time periods, dimensions, and activity codes
- **Smart context generation** for AI injection
- **Summary statistics** for recent activity patterns
- **Batch processing** for multiple activity detection

**Key Methods:**
- `logActivity()` / `logActivities()` for storage
- `getRecentActivities()`, `getTodayActivities()` for retrieval
- `generateActivityContext()` for AI prompt injection
- `getActivitiesByDimension()` for Oracle framework analysis

### 4. Enhanced SystemMCPService
**File:** `lib/services/system_mcp_service.dart`

- **New `extract_activities` function** for AI-callable activity detection
- **Basic keyword detection** for common activities (placeholder for full AI)
- **Oracle framework integration** using dynamic parser
- **Custom activity detection** for non-Oracle activities
- **Structured JSON responses** with confidence scoring

**Integration Points:**
- Calls `OracleActivityParser.parseFromPersona()` for dynamic activity catalog
- Basic detection for: caminhada, exercício, água, leitura, meditação
- Returns detected activities with confidence scores and metadata

### 5. Enhanced ClaudeService Integration
**File:** `lib/services/claude_service.dart`

- **Activity context injection** in system prompts
- **MCP command processing** for `extract_activities`
- **Automatic activity logging** when AI detects activities
- **Seamless integration** with existing time context (FT-060)

**Workflow:**
1. Generates activity context from `ActivityMemoryService`
2. Injects context into system prompt with time awareness
3. AI calls `extract_activities` when user mentions completed activities
4. System processes MCP call and logs detected activities
5. Removes MCP commands from user-visible responses

### 6. Database Integration
**File:** `lib/services/chat_storage_service.dart`

- **Added ActivityModelSchema** to Isar database initialization
- **Seamless integration** with existing chat message storage
- **Shared database instance** across services

**File:** `lib/screens/chat_screen.dart`

- **ActivityMemoryService initialization** with Isar instance
- **Service lifecycle management** in chat screen setup

## Testing Implementation

### Unit Tests
**File:** `test/features/activity_memory_unit_test.dart`

- **Oracle parsing validation** with graceful fallback testing
- **SystemMCP extract_activities** command validation
- **Activity detection logic** testing for Portuguese and English
- **Error handling** for missing parameters and invalid commands
- **Integration verification** of get_current_time functionality

### Test Compilation Fixes
**Files:** `test/services/claude_service_test.dart`, `test/services/system_mcp_service_test.dart`, `test/claude_service_test.dart`

- **Fixed async method signatures** for `processCommand()` method changes
- **Updated mock patterns** to handle `Future<String>` returns
- **Maintained test coverage** for existing functionality

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Dynamic vs Hardcoded Approach
**Decision:** Full dynamic parsing from Oracle prompt files
**Rationale:** User feedback emphasized avoiding hardcoded Oracle activities and dimensions
**Implementation:** Regular expressions to extract structured data from markdown

### 2. Basic vs AI-Powered Detection
**Decision:** Implemented basic keyword detection as foundation
**Rationale:** "Simplest thing that could work" approach for initial implementation
**Future:** Framework ready for full AI-powered activity detection

### 3. Local vs Remote Storage
**Decision:** Local Isar database for activity memory
**Rationale:** Consistency with existing chat storage, offline functionality
**Future:** Architecture supports migration to remote endpoints

### 4. Time Integration Strategy
**Decision:** Leverage existing FT-060 precise time awareness
**Rationale:** Reuse proven time infrastructure for activity timestamps
**Implementation:** ActivityModel includes detailed temporal data

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- **Oracle parsing results cached** by persona key
- **Cache invalidation** when persona changes
- **Memory-efficient** storage of parsed definitions

### Database Queries
- **Indexed fields** for common queries (completedAt, dimension, activityCode)
- **Efficient filtering** by time ranges and activity types
- **Batch operations** for multiple activity logging

## Integration Points

### With FT-060 (Time Awareness)
- Activity timestamps use precise time data from `get_current_time`
- Time context and activity context co-exist in system prompts
- Temporal patterns available for activity analysis

### With MCP Architecture
- `extract_activities` follows established MCP command patterns
- Consistent JSON response format with other MCP functions
- Error handling aligned with existing MCP error patterns

### With Persona System
- Oracle activities dynamically loaded per active persona
- Graceful handling when personas lack Oracle configurations
- Custom activities work regardless of Oracle availability

## Verification Results

### Test Results
- **7/7 unit tests passing** for core FT-061 functionality
- **Activity detection working** for Portuguese keywords
- **MCP integration verified** with proper JSON responses
- **Error handling validated** for edge cases

### Manual Testing
- **App successfully builds** with all FT-061 components
- **iOS simulator ready** for interactive testing
- **Clean integration** with existing features

## Future Enhancements

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Enhanced AI Detection:** Replace basic keywords with full AI analysis
2. **Pattern Recognition:** Identify user activity patterns and habits
3. **Goal Integration:** Connect activities to Oracle framework goals
4. **Reminder System:** Proactive suggestions based on activity history

### Technical Improvements
1. **Performance Optimization:** Database query optimization for large datasets
2. **Sync Architecture:** Remote backup and cross-device synchronization
3. **Analytics Dashboard:** User-facing activity insights and trends
4. **Export Functionality:** Activity data export for external analysis

## Conclusion

FT-061 Oracle Activity Memory implementation successfully provides AI personas with structured, time-aware activity tracking. The dynamic parsing approach eliminates hardcoding concerns while maintaining full Oracle framework compatibility. The foundation is ready for enhanced AI-powered detection and advanced activity analytics.
