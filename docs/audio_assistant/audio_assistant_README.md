# Audio Assistant Feature Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the audio assistant feature implementation. The feature adds Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities to the AI assistant, allowing messages to be both read and heard.

## Documentation Overview

- **[Implementation Plan (Detailed)](audio_assistant_implementation_plan_detailed.md)**: Comprehensive implementation plan with tasks and steps
- **[Testing Strategy](audio_assistant_testing_strategy.md)**: Detailed testing approach across all levels
- **[Executive Summary](audio_assistant_implementation_executive_summary.md)**: High-level overview of the implementation approach
- **[Task Tracker](audio_assistant_task_tracker.md)**: Tracking document for implementation progress
- **[Implementation Summary](audio_assistant_implementation_summary.md)**: Summary of the implementation approach

## Task Documentation

Detailed implementation guides for each task:

- **[Task 1: Setup](tasks/task1_setup_implementation.md)**: Environment preparation and test infrastructure
- **[Task 2: ClaudeService Integration](tasks/task2_claude_service_tts_implementation.md)**: Core service integration with TTS
- **[Task 3: ChatMessageModel Updates](tasks/task3_chat_message_model_updates.md)**: Data model enhancements
- **[Task 4: ChatScreen Integration](tasks/task4_chat_screen_integration.md)**: UI integration for audio messages

- **[Task 6: Error Handling](tasks/task6_error_handling.md)**: Robust error handling implementation

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation follows a defensive, test-driven approach with these key principles:

1. **Incremental Development**: Each component is implemented and tested separately
2. **Test-First Methodology**: Tests are written before implementation code
3. **Defensive Testing**: Thorough testing of both success and failure paths
4. **Continuous Validation**: Regular verification that existing functionality remains intact

## Getting Started

To begin implementing the audio assistant feature:

1. Read the [Implementation Analysis](audio_defensive_testing_analysis_20250516.md) to understand the current state
2. Review the [Implementation Plan](audio_assistant_implementation_plan_detailed.md) for a detailed roadmap
3. Start with [Task 1: Setup](tasks/task1_setup_implementation.md) to prepare the environment
4. Follow each task sequentially, completing all tests before proceeding
5. Use the [Task Tracker](audio_assistant_task_tracker.md) to monitor progress

## Test-Driven Development

Each task includes specific tests that should be written and run before implementing the actual functionality. This ensures robust error handling and maintains code quality throughout the development process.

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

- All tasks are completed with associated tests passing
- The feature works reliably on both iOS and Android platforms
- Error handling is robust with appropriate user feedback
- Performance metrics meet or exceed targets
- Existing functionality remains intact
