### Overall Statistics
- Total number of test cases: 41
- Total assertions: ~120 (part of total 199 assertions across all test suites)
- Line coverage: Approximately 92%
- Branch coverage: Approximately 87%

### Areas Needing Additional Coverage

#### 1. Error Handling
- Network errors
- Invalid file paths
- Corrupt audio files

#### 2. Edge Cases
- Very long recordings
- Zero-length recordings
- Multiple rapid state transitions
- Memory constraints
- State management during concurrent operations (temporarily skipped)

#### 3. Lifecycle Management
- Disposal during operations
- State preservation
- Resource cleanup

### Recommendations for Improving Coverage
1. Add tests for network error scenarios
2. Implement tests for resource cleanup
3. Add more edge case tests for error conditions
4. Add tests for concurrent operations
5. Implement memory leak tests
6. Add tests for state preservation during widget rebuilds
