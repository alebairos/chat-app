### Overall Statistics
- Total number of test cases: 38
- Total assertions: ~100
- Line coverage: Approximately 90%
- Branch coverage: Approximately 85%

### Areas Needing Additional Coverage

#### 1. Error Handling
- Permission denial scenarios
- Network errors
- Invalid file paths
- Corrupt audio files

#### 2. Edge Cases
- Very long recordings
- Zero-length recordings
- Multiple rapid state transitions
- Memory constraints

#### 3. Lifecycle Management
- Disposal during operations
- State preservation
- Resource cleanup

### Recommendations for Improving Coverage
1. Add tests for permission denial scenarios
2. Implement tests for resource cleanup
3. Add more edge case tests for error conditions
4. Add tests for concurrent operations
5. Implement memory leak tests
6. Add tests for state preservation during widget rebuilds
