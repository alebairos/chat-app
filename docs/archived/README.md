# Archived Features

This directory contains feature specifications that have been archived for various reasons:

## FT-136: Consolidated Persona Voice Configuration
**Archived:** Redundant with FT-137  
**Reason:** FT-137 provides a more comprehensive specification for the same voice configuration consolidation feature  
**Date Archived:** 2025-09-19  

FT-136 and FT-137 were modeling identical solutions for consolidating voice configuration into the `audioFormatting` section of `personas_config.json`. FT-137 was kept as the canonical specification due to:
- More detailed technical implementation
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Better structured acceptance criteria
- More realistic effort estimation
- Complete migration guide

## Archive Policy
