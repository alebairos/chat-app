- **Focus**: Physical health, mental health, spiritual wellness
- **Timeframe**: Months 1-3 (80% focus)
- **Goal**: Establish stable foundation before other development

#### **SKILL Pillar** (Professional & Cognitive Development)  
- **Strategy**: PLOW (Planning, Learning, Orchestration, Work)
- **Focus**: Productivity, leadership, learning efficiency
- **Timeframe**: Months 2-6 (50% focus)
- **Goal**: Build competencies on stable energy foundation

#### **CONNECTION Pillar** (Relationships & Purpose)
- **Strategy**: GLOWS (Gratitude, Love, Orchestration, Willingness to Help, Spirituality)
- **Focus**: Relationships, meaning, service, transcendence
- **Timeframe**: Months 4+ (50% focus)

## Conclusion

Version 2.0 represents a significant evolution from a foundational coaching system to a sophisticated, strategic life management platform. The three-pillar architecture addresses the core limitation of v1.0 - the potential for overwhelm and lack of clear prioritization.

**Key Success Factors for v2.0**:
1. **Sequential Development**: Energy → Skill → Connection prevents overwhelm
2. **Measurement-Driven**: Clear scoring system enables data-driven decisions
3. **Strategic Integration**: MEEDDS/PLOW/GLOWS provide actionable frameworks
4. **Sustainable Progression**: Built-in progression criteria prevent premature advancement

**Recommendation**: Implement v2.0 as the primary system with v1.0 available as a "simplified mode" for users who prefer linear progression. The sophistication of v2.0 better serves the long-term goals of comprehensive life management coaching while maintaining the evidence-based foundation that makes the Oracle system effective.

The investment in v2.0's complexity is justified by its potential for significantly better long-term outcomes and user satisfaction, particularly for clients seeking comprehensive life transformation rather than isolated habit change.
