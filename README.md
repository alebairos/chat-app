# Chat App with Relative Path Storage

## Overview

This app implements a robust solution for audio file path storage in a Flutter chat application. The solution addresses the issue of app container UUIDs changing between runs, which can make absolute paths unreliable.

## Path Storage Strategy

### Relative Paths in Database

Instead of storing absolute paths like `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/UUID-123/Documents/audio/file.mp3`, we store relative paths like `audio/file.mp3`. This approach provides several benefits:

- **Resilience to App Container Changes**: App container UUIDs change between runs, making absolute paths unreliable
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Relative paths remain valid across app restarts and device changes
- **Smaller Storage Footprint**: Relative paths take up less space in the database

## Implementation Details

### Path Utilities

The `PathUtils` class (`lib/utils/path_utils.dart`) provides utility methods for handling path conversion:

- `absoluteToRelative`: Converts an absolute path to a relative path based on the app's documents directory
- `relativeToAbsolute`: Converts a relative path to an absolute path by prepending the app's documents directory
- `isAbsolutePath`: Checks if a path is absolute
- `fileExists`: Checks if a file exists at the given path (handles both absolute and relative paths)
- `ensureDirectoryExists`: Creates a directory if it doesn't exist

### Path Handling in Code

- **When saving**: The app stores only relative paths (e.g., `audio/audio_1746818143828.m4a`)
- **When loading**: The app reconstructs the full path by prepending the app documents directory
- **Path validation**: The app includes validation to ensure path format consistency

### Migration of Existing Data

A migration utility is included to convert existing absolute paths to relative paths:

```dart
// In ChatStorageService
Future<void> migratePathsToRelative() async {
  final isar = await db;
  final messages = await isar.chatMessageModels
      .where()
      .filter()
      .mediaPathIsNotNull()
      .findAll();
  
  int migratedCount = 0;
  await isar.writeTxn(() async {
    for (final message in messages) {
      if (message.mediaPath != null && PathUtils.isAbsolutePath(message.mediaPath!)) {
        final relativePath = await PathUtils.absoluteToRelative(message.mediaPath!);
        if (relativePath != null) {
          message.mediaPath = relativePath;
          await isar.chatMessageModels.put(message);
          migratedCount++;
        }
      }
    }
  });
  
  print('Migrated $migratedCount paths from absolute to relative');
}
```

## Testing

The path utilities are thoroughly tested with four dedicated test files:

1. **Basic Path Operations**: `test/utils/path_utils_test.dart`
   - Tests for `isAbsolutePath`, `getFileName`, `getDirName`, etc.

2. **Path Normalization**: `test/utils/path_utils_normalization_test.dart`
   - Tests for handling various path formats and edge cases

3. **File Operations**: `test/utils/path_utils_file_exists_test.dart`
   - Tests for `fileExists` with mocked file system

4. **Integration Tests**: `test/utils/path_utils_integration_test.dart`
   - Tests for path conversion with actual file system

Run the tests with:

```bash
./test_scripts/run_test_group6.sh
```

## Usage

The solution is automatically applied when the app starts:

1. The `ChatScreen` initializes the storage service
2. The storage service runs the migration to convert any existing absolute paths to relative
3. All new audio recordings are stored with relative paths
4. When playing audio files, the paths are converted back to absolute as needed

This approach ensures that audio files remain accessible across app restarts and updates, providing a more reliable user experience.
