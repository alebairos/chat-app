## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Run the app using `flutter run`

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your API key for the Claude AI service
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your API key for OpenAI Whisper transcription
- `ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY` or `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: Your API key for ElevenLabs TTS service (optional, falls back to mock TTS if not provided)

## Audio Assistant Features

### Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration
The app includes a comprehensive TTS system that automatically generates audio versions of assistant responses:

- **Provider-Based Architecture**: Supports multiple TTS providers through a unified interface
- **ElevenLabs Integration**: High-quality voice synthesis using ElevenLabs API
- **Intelligent Fallbacks**: Automatically falls back to mock TTS if ElevenLabs is unavailable
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of TTS failures with text-only responses
- **Audio Playback Controls**: Play, pause, resume functionality for generated audio
- **Test Mode Support**: Mock TTS provider for testing and development

### Audio Response Flow
1. User sends a message to the chat
2. Claude AI generates a text response
3. TTS service automatically generates audio for the response
4. Both text and audio are displayed in the chat interface
5. Users can play, pause, and control audio playback

### Supported TTS Providers
- **ElevenLabs**: Professional-grade voice synthesis (requires API key)
- **Mock TTS**: Development and testing provider (no API key required)

### Emotional TTS Preprocessing

The app features an advanced emotional preprocessing system that enhances voice synthesis with intelligent text analysis:

#### Key Features
- **Smart Action Removal**: Automatically removes narrative action descriptions (`*chuckles warmly*`, `*cruza os bra√ßos pensativamente*`) from spoken text while preserving their emotional context
- **Emotional Voice Modulation**: Dynamically adjusts ElevenLabs voice parameters based on detected emotions:
  - **Thoughtful**: More contemplative, deliberate tone (stability ‚Üì20%, style +0.1)
  - **Warm**: Friendlier, more approachable voice (similarity_boost +0.1, style +0.2)
  - **Playful**: More dynamic, expressive delivery (stability ‚Üì30%, style +0.3)
  - **Serious**: More authoritative, stable tone (stability +0.2, style -0.1)
  - **Confident**: More assertive, clear voice (similarity_boost +0.15)

#### Multi-Language Support
- **Portuguese Patterns**: `pensativamente`, `cruza os bra√ßos`, `inclina a cabe√ßa`, `esperando`
- **English Patterns**: `thoughtfully`, `chuckles warmly`, `leans in with a smirk`, `strokes chin`
- **Intelligent Detection**: Context-aware pattern matching that distinguishes actions from emphasis

#### Processing Pipeline
1. **Emotional Extraction**: Analyze original text for emotional context from action descriptions
2. **Text Cleaning**: Remove narrative elements while preserving important emphasized content
3. **Voice Parameter Calculation**: Map detected emotions to ElevenLabs voice adjustments
4. **Synthesis**: Generate speech with emotionally-appropriate voice parameters

#### Example Transformations
```
Input:  "*cruza os bra√ßos pensativamente* Como um legion√°rio romano, **O conhecimento n√£o tem fronteiras!**"
Output: "Como um legion√°rio romano, O conhecimento n√£o tem fronteiras!" (spoken with thoughtful tone)

Input:  "*chuckles warmly* That's absolutely fantastic news!"
Output: "That's absolutely fantastic news!" (spoken with warm, friendly tone)
```

# Chat App with Relative Path Storage

## Overview

This app implements a robust solution for audio file path storage in a Flutter chat application. The solution addresses the issue of app container UUIDs changing between runs, which can make absolute paths unreliable.

## Path Storage Strategy

### Relative Paths in Database

Instead of storing absolute paths like `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/UUID-123/Documents/audio/file.mp3`, we store relative paths like `audio/file.mp3`. This approach provides several benefits:

- **Resilience to App Container Changes**: App container UUIDs change between runs, making absolute paths unreliable
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Relative paths remain valid across app restarts and device changes
- **Smaller Storage Footprint**: Relative paths take up less space in the database

## Implementation Details

### Path Utilities

The `PathUtils` class (`lib/utils/path_utils.dart`) provides utility methods for handling path conversion:

- `absoluteToRelative`: Converts an absolute path to a relative path based on the app's documents directory
- `relativeToAbsolute`: Converts a relative path to an absolute path by prepending the app's documents directory
- `isAbsolutePath`: Checks if a path is absolute
- `fileExists`: Checks if a file exists at the given path (handles both absolute and relative paths)
- `ensureDirectoryExists`: Creates a directory if it doesn't exist

### Path Handling in Code

- **When saving**: The app stores only relative paths (e.g., `audio/audio_1746818143828.m4a`)
- **When loading**: The app reconstructs the full path by prepending the app documents directory
- **Path validation**: The app includes validation to ensure path format consistency

### Migration of Existing Data

A migration utility is included to convert existing absolute paths to relative paths:

```dart
// In ChatStorageService
Future<void> migratePathsToRelative() async {
  final isar = await db;
  final messages = await isar.chatMessageModels
      .where()
      .filter()
      .mediaPathIsNotNull()
      .findAll();
  
  int migratedCount = 0;
  await isar.writeTxn(() async {
    for (final message in messages) {
      if (message.mediaPath != null && PathUtils.isAbsolutePath(message.mediaPath!)) {
        final relativePath = await PathUtils.absoluteToRelative(message.mediaPath!);
        if (relativePath != null) {
          message.mediaPath = relativePath;
          await isar.chatMessageModels.put(message);
          migratedCount++;
        }
      }
    }
  });
  
  print('Migrated $migratedCount paths from absolute to relative');
}
```

## Testing

The path utilities are thoroughly tested with four dedicated test files:

1. **Basic Path Operations**: `test/utils/path_utils_test.dart`
   - Tests for `isAbsolutePath`, `getFileName`, `getDirName`, etc.

2. **Path Normalization**: `test/utils/path_utils_normalization_test.dart`
   - Tests for handling various path formats and edge cases

3. **File Operations**: `test/utils/path_utils_file_exists_test.dart`
   - Tests for `fileExists` with mocked file system

4. **Integration Tests**: `test/utils/path_utils_integration_test.dart`
   - Tests for path conversion with actual file system

Run the tests with:

```bash
./test_scripts/run_test_group6.sh
```

## Usage

The solution is automatically applied when the app starts:

1. The `ChatScreen` initializes the storage service
2. The storage service runs the migration to convert any existing absolute paths to relative
3. All new audio recordings are stored with relative paths
4. When playing audio files, the paths are converted back to absolute as needed

This approach ensures that audio files remain accessible across app restarts and updates, providing a more reliable user experience.
